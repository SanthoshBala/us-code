When warranted by the circumstances, the Secretary concerned may reconsider and change or modify any such determination. The authority of the Secretary concerned under this subsection may be delegated. Any determination made under this section with regard to a member of the uniformed services is final and is not subject to review by any accounting officer of the United States or a court, unless there is fraud or gross negligence.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) Parking facilities (including utility connections) provided members of the uniformed services for house trailers and mobile homes not owned by the Government shall not be considered to be quarters for the purposes of this section or any other provision of law. Any fees established by the Government for the use of such a facility shall be established in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance, services, and utilities and to amortize the cost of construction of the facility over the 25-year period beginning with the completion of such construction.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(l) Temporary Continuation of Allowance for Dependents of Members Dying on Active Duty.—(1) The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of <ins>Homeland Security</ins> <del>Transportation</del> in the case of the Coast Guard when not operating as a service in the Navy, may allow the dependents of a member of the armed forces who dies on active duty and whose dependents are occupying family housing provided by the Department of Defense, or by the Department of <ins>Homeland Security</ins> <del>Transportation</del> in the case of the Coast Guard, other than on a rental basis on the date of the member's death to continue to occupy such housing without charge for a period of 180 days.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may pay a basic allowance for housing (at the rate that is payable for members of the same grade and dependency status as the deceased member for the area where the dependents are residing) to the dependents of a member of the uniformed services who dies while on active duty and whose dependents—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are not occupying a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service on the date of the member's death;</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are occupying such housing on a rental basis on such date; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) vacate such housing sooner than 180 days after the date of the member's death.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) The payment of the allowance under paragraph (2) shall terminate 180 days after the date of the member's death.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(m) Members Paying Child Support.—(1) A member of a uniformed service with dependents may not be paid a basic allowance for housing at the with dependents rate solely by reason of the payment of child support by the member if—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the member is assigned to a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the member is assigned to sea duty, and elects not to occupy assigned quarters for unaccompanied personnel, unless the member is in a pay grade above E–3.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service who is not otherwise authorized a basic allowance for housing and who pays child support is entitled to the basic allowance for housing differential, except for months for which the amount payable for the child support is less than the rate of the differential. Payment of a basic allowance for housing differential does not affect any entitlement of the member to a partial allowance for quarters under subsection (n).</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) The basic allowance for housing differential to which a member is entitled under paragraph (2) is the amount equal to the difference between—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the rate of the basic allowance for quarters (with dependents) for the member's pay grade, as such rate was in effect on December 31, 1997, under this section (as in effect on that date); and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rate of the basic allowance for quarters (without dependents) for the member's pay grade, as such rate was in effect on December 31, 1997, under this section (as in effect on that date).</p> <p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever the rates of basic pay for members of the uniformed services are increased, the monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing differential computed under paragraph (3) shall be increased by the average percentage increase in the rates of basic pay. The effective date of the increase shall be the same date as the effective date of the increase in the rates of basic pay.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of two members, who have one or more common dependents (and no others), who are not married to each other, and one of whom pays child support to the other, the amount of the basic allowance for housing paid to each member under this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. The total amount of the basic allowances for housing paid to the two members may not exceed the sum of the amounts of the allowance to which each member would be otherwise entitled under this section.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(n) Partial Allowance for Members Without Dependents.—(1) A member of a uniformed service without dependents who is not entitled to receive a basic allowance for housing under subsection (b), (c), or (d) is entitled to a partial basic allowance for housing at a rate determined by the Secretary of Defense under paragraph (2).</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) The rate of the partial basic allowance for housing is the partial rate of the basic allowance for quarters for the member's pay grade as such partial rate was in effect on December 31, 1997, under section 1009(c)(2) of this title (as such section was in effect on such date).</p> <p class="statutory-body"><ins>(o) Treatment of Low-Cost and No-Cost Moves as Not Being Reassignments.—In the case of a member who is assigned to duty at a location or under circumstances that make it necessary for the member to be reassigned under the conditions of low-cost or no-cost permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment, the member may be treated for the purposes of this section as if the member were not reassigned if the Secretary concerned determines that it would be inequitable to base the member's entitlement to, and amount of, a basic allowance for housing on the cost of housing in the area to which the member is reassigned.</ins></p> <p class="source-credit">Pub.

An increase in weight allowance under this subparagraph may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allowance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades O–6 to O–10, unless the additional weight allowance in excess of such maximum is intended to permit the shipping of consumables that cannot be reasonably obtained at the new station of the member. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subparagraph.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(E) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of <ins>Homeland Security</ins> <del>Transportation</del> for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy, and midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy shall be entitled, in connection with temporary or permanent station change, to transportation of baggage and household effects as provided in subparagraph (A). The weight allowance for cadets and midshipmen is 350 pounds.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(F) A member entitled to transportation of baggage and household effects under subparagraph (A) may, as an alternative to the provision of transportation, be paid reimbursement or, at the member's request, a monetary allowance in advance for the cost of transportation of the baggage and household effects. The monetary allowance may be paid only if the amount of the allowance does not exceed the cost that would be incurred by the Government under subparagraph (A) for the transportation of the baggage and household effects. Appropriations available to the Department of Defense, the Department of <ins>Homeland Security,</ins> <del>Transportation,</del> and the Department of Health and Human Services for providing transportation of baggage or household effects of members of the uniformed services shall be available to pay a reimbursement or monetary allowance under this subparagraph. The Secretary concerned may prescribe the manner in which the risk of liability for damage, destruction, or loss of baggage or household effects arranged, packed, crated, or loaded by a member is allocated among the member, the United States, and any contractor when a reimbursement or monetary allowance is elected under this subparagraph.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(G) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned may pay a member a share (determined pursuant to such regulations) of the savings resulting to the United States when the total weights of the member's baggage and household effects shipped and stored under subparagraph (A) are less than the average weights of the baggage and household effects that are shipped and stored, respectively, by other members in the same grade and with the same dependents status as the member in connection with changes of station that are comparable to the member's change of station. The total savings shall be equal to the difference between the cost of shipping and cost of storing such average weights of baggage and household effects, respectively, and the corresponding costs associated with the weights of the member's baggage and household effects. For the administration of this subparagraph, the Secretary of Defense shall annually determine the average weights of baggage and household effects shipped and stored in connection with a change of temporary or permanent station.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) The transportation and allowances authorized under paragraph (1) may be paid or provided to a member upon his separation from the service or release from active duty only if the member applies for the transportation and allowances not later than 180 days after the date of his separation or release from active duty. If a member to whom this paragraph applies has been authorized nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the 180-day period shall not begin until such authorization for nontemporary storage expires. This paragraph does not apply to a member to whom subsection (g)(1) applies.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(c) The allowances and transportation authorized by subsections (a) and (b) are in addition to those authorized by sections 403(c), 404, and 405 of this title and are—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subject to such conditions and limitations;</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for such grades, ranks, and ratings; and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to and from such places;</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">prescribed by the Secretaries concerned. Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs. However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States. However, the weight of baggage and household effects stored, plus the weight of the baggage and household effects transported, in connection with a change of station may not be more than the maximum weight limitations in regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned when it is not otherwise fixed by law. In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate. The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the member is serving on permanent duty at a station outside the United States, in Hawaii or Alaska, or on sea duty.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, transportation for dependents, baggage, and household effects of a member, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, is authorized if he dies while entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member who—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is involuntarily separated from active duty during the period beginning on October 1, 1990, and ending on December 31, 2001,</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">is, not later than one year from the date he is so retired, placed on that list, involuntarily separated, discharged, or released, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned, entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects to the home selected under section 404(c) of this title, and to a per diem for his dependents. In addition, baggage and household effects may be shipped to a location other than the home selected by the member.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) If baggage and household effects of a member are shipped to a place selected by a member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title or to a location other than the home selected by the member, or if transportation is provided for a member's dependents to a place selected by the member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title, and the costs of that shipment or transportation are in excess of those that would have been incurred if the shipment had been made or the transportation had been provided to a location in the United States (other than Alaska or Hawaii), the member shall pay that excess cost.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) If a member authorized to select a home under section 404(c) of this title accrues that right or any entitlement under this subsection but dies before he exercises it, that right or entitlement accrues to and may be exercised by his surviving dependents or, if there are no surviving dependents, his baggage and household effects may be shipped to the home of the person legally entitled to such baggage and effects. However, if baggage and household effects are shipped under circumstances described in paragraph (2) in which the member would have been required to pay the excess costs of that shipment, the surviving dependents or the person legally entitled to the baggage and household effects, as the case may be, shall pay that excess cost.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) If the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the best interests of a member described in paragraph (2) or the member's dependents and the United States, the Secretary may, when orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) authorize the movement of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects at the station to an appropriate location in the United States or its possessions or, if the dependents are foreign nationals, to the country of the dependents’ origin and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof, as the case may be, plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b); and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a member described in paragraph (2)(A), authorize the transportation of one motor vehicle, which is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of a dependent of the member, to that location by means of transportation authorized under section 2634 of title 10 or authorize the storage of the motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">If the member's baggage and household effects are in nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may authorize their movement to the location concerned and prescribe transportation in kind or reimbursement therefor, as authorized under subsection (b). For the purposes of this section, a member's unmarried child for whom the member received transportation in kind to his station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof and who, by reason of age or graduation from (or cessation of enrollment in) an institution of higher education, would otherwise cease to be a dependent of the member while the member was serving at that station shall still be considered as a dependent of the member.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) A member referred to in paragraph (1) is a member who—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is serving at a station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska;</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receives an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is sentenced by a court-martial—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to be confined for a period of more than 30 days,</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to receive a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) to be dismissed from a uniformed service.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under this subsection does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use.
