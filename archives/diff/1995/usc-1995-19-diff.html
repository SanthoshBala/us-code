Before making recommendations regarding any such adjustments, the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide adequate opportunity for public comment. The recommendations shall, as precisely as possible, propose fees which reflect the actual costs to the United States Government for the commercial services provided by the United States Customs Service.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(5) At the close of each of fiscal years 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the amount of the fees collected under paragraph (5)(A) of subsection (a) of this section for that fiscal year that exceeds the amount of such fees that would have been collected for such fiscal year if the fees that were in effect on the day before the effective date of this paragraph applied to such fiscal year.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, any penalty expressed in terms of a relationship to the amount of the duty shall be treated as not less than the amount which bears a similar relationship to the amount of the fee assessed. For purposes of determining the jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any agency of the United States, any fee prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as if such fee is a customs duty.</p> <h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Omitted</h4> <h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Effect on other authority</h4> <p class="statutory-body">Except with respect to customs services for which fees are imposed under subsection (a) of this section, nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to charge fees under section 58a of this title.</p> <h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Effective dates</h4> <p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the provisions of this section, and the amendments and repeals made by this section, shall apply with respect to customs services rendered after the date that is 90 days after April 7, 1986.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) Fees may be charged under subsection (a)(5) of this section only with respect to customs services rendered in regard to arriving passengers using transportation for which documents or tickets were issued after the date that is 90 days after April 7, 1986.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) Fees may not be charged under subsection (a) of this section after September 30, 2003.</p> <p class="source-credit">Pub.

The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers refuse such entry.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the Commission to order an exclusion from entry of articles shall be limited to persons determined by the Commission to be violating this section unless the Commission determines that—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a general exclusion from entry of articles is necessary to prevent circumvention of an exclusion order limited to products of named persons; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is a pattern of violation of this section and it is difficult to identify the source of infringing products.</p> <h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion of articles from entry during investigation except under bond; procedures applicable; preliminary relief</h4> <p class="statutory-body">(1) If, during the course of an investigation under this section, the Commission determines that there is reason to believe that there is a violation of this section, it may direct that the articles concerned, imported by any person with respect to whom there is reason to believe that such person is violating this section, be excluded from entry into the United States, unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers, refuse such entry, except that such articles shall be entitled to entry under bond prescribed by the Secretary in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the complainant.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) A complainant may petition the Commission for the issuance of an order under this subsection.

The Commission may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it deems proper, modify or revoke any such order, and, in the case of a revocation, may take action under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as the case may be. If a temporary cease and desist order is issued in addition to, or in lieu of, an exclusion order under subsection (e) of this section, the Commission may require the complainant to post a bond, in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the respondent from any injury, as a prerequisite to the issuance of an order under this subsection. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has not violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the respondent. The Commission shall prescribe the terms and conditions under which the bonds may be forfeited under this paragraph.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who violates an order issued by the Commission under paragraph (1) after it has become final shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty for each day on which an importation of articles, or their sale, occurs in violation of the order of not more than the greater of $100,000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold on such day in violation of the order. Such penalty shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered for the United States in a civil action brought by the Commission in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation occurs. In such actions, the United States district courts may issue mandatory injunctions incorporating the relief sought by the Commission as they deem appropriate in the enforcement of such final orders of the Commission.</p> <h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusion from entry or cease and desist order;

Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a preliminary determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority.

which notice of the determination to initiate the investigation is published in the Federal Register, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall make available to the Commission all information upon which such determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its injury determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">The instructions of the administering authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) may not remain in effect for more than 4 months, except that the administering authority may, at the request of exporters representing a significant proportion of exports of the subject merchandise, extend that 4-month period to not more than 6 months.</p> <h4

its original petition, or by amendment at any time more than 20 days before the date of a final determination by the administering authority, then the administering authority shall promptly (at any time after the initiation of the investigation under this part) determine, on the basis of the information available to it at that time, whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there was likely to be material injury by reason of such sales, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The administering authority shall be treated as having made an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A) in any investigation to which subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section is applied.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension of liquidation</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority under paragraph (1) is affirmative, then any suspension of liquidation ordered under subsection (d)(2) of this section shall apply, or, if notice of such suspension of liquidation is already published, be amended to apply, to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date which is 90 days before the date on which the suspension of liquidation was first ordered, or</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date on which notice of the determination to initiate the

This subparagraph applies only with respect to the first withdrawal of a petition.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rules for quantitative restriction agreements</h4> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the administering authority may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) by

on the basis of that agreement is in the public interest.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Public interest factors</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest the administering authority shall take into account—</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether, based upon the relative impact on consumer prices and the availability of supplies of the merchandise, the agreement would have a greater adverse impact on United States consumers than the imposition of antidumping duties;</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior consultations</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">Before making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall, to the extent practicable, consult with—</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) potentially

under paragraph (1) before a preliminary determination is made by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title.</p> <h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreements to eliminate completely sales at less than fair value or to cease exports of merchandise</h4> <p class="statutory-body">The administering authority may suspend an investigation if the exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all of the imports of that merchandise agree—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to cease exports of the merchandise to the United States within 6 months after the date on which the investigation is suspended, or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to revise their prices to eliminate completely any amount by which the normal value of the merchandise which is the subject of the agreement exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of that merchandise.</p> <h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreements eliminating injurious effect</h4> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority determines that extraordinary circumstances are present in a case, it may suspend an investigation upon the acceptance of an agreement to revise prices from exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all of the imports of that merchandise into the United States, if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of exports to the United States of that merchandise and if—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of that merchandise will be prevented, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for each entry of each exporter the amount by which the estimated normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) will not exceed 15 percent of the weighted average amount by which the estimated normal value exceeded the export price (or the constructed export price) for all less-than-fair-value entries of the exporter examined during the course of the investigation.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) “Extraordinary circumstances” defined</h4> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Extraordinary circumstances</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term “extraordinary circumstances”

entries of such merchandise was suspended pursuant to a previous affirmative preliminary determination in the same case with respect to such merchandise, that suspension of liquidation shall terminate, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the administering authority shall refund any cash deposit and release any bond or other security deposited under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this

pursuant to a previous affirmative preliminary determination in the same case, that suspension of liquidation shall continue in effect, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, but the security required under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title may be adjusted to reflect the effect of the agreement.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Where investigation is continued</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">If, pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, the administering authority and the Commission continue an investigation in which an agreement has been accepted under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, then—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the final determination by the administering authority or the Commission under section 1673d of this title is negative, the agreement shall have no force or effect and the investigation shall be terminated, or</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the final determinations by the administering authority and

amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise is not less than 15 percent ad valorem.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subject of affirmative dumping determination</h4> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">Short life cycle merchandise of a

the amount by which the normal value of such merchandise of the manufacturer exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of such merchandise of the manufacturer, and</p> <p

affirmative dumping determination.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusion</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">Short life cycle merchandise of a manufacturer shall not be treated as being the subject of an affirmative dumping determination if—</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such merchandise of the manufacturer is part of a group of merchandise to which the administering authority assigns (in lieu of making separate determinations described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I)) an amount determined to be the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise in such group exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise in such group, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the merchandise and the manufacturer are not specified by name in the affirmative dumping determination or in any antidumping duty order issued as a result of such affirmative dumping determination.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Short life cycle merchandise</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">The term “short life cycle merchandise” means any product that the Commission determines is likely to become outmoded within 4 years, by reason of technological advances,

The Commission shall consider the likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The Commission shall take into account—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) its prior injury determinations, including the volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry before the order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted,</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether any improvement in the state of the industry is related to the order or the suspension agreement,</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the industry is vulnerable to material injury if the order is revoked or the suspension agreement is terminated, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in an antidumping proceeding under section 1675(c) of this title, the findings of the administering authority regarding duty absorption under section 1675(a)(4) of this title.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Volume</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be significant if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States. In so doing, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors, including—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any likely increase in production capacity or existing unused production capacity in the exporting country,</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) existing inventories of the subject merchandise, or likely increases in inventories,</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the existence of barriers to the importation of such merchandise into countries other than the United States, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Price</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely price effects of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is likely to be significant price underselling by imports of the subject merchandise as compared to domestic like products, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) imports of the subject merchandise are likely to enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of domestic like products.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Impact on the industry</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) likely declines in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization of capacity,</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) likely negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) likely negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this paragraph within the context of the business cycle and the conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Basis for determination</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under this subsection shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the Commission's determination of whether material injury is likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. In making that determination, the Commission shall consider that the effects of revocation or termination may not be imminent, but may manifest themselves only over a longer period of time.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Magnitude of margin of dumping and net countervailable subsidy; nature of countervailable subsidy</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission may consider the magnitude of the margin of dumping or the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy. If a countervailable subsidy is involved the Commission shall consider information regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Cumulation</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which reviews under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title were initiated on the same day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market. The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effects of imports of the subject merchandise in a case in which it determines that such imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special rule for regional industries</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title involving a regional industry, the Commission may base its determination on the regional industry defined in the original investigation under this subtitle, another region that satisfies the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title, or the United States as a whole. In determining if a regional industry analysis is appropriate for the determination in the review, the Commission shall consider whether the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title are likely to be satisfied if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated.</p> <h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy</h4> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title, the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1671c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy. The administering authority shall consider—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the net countervailable subsidy determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether any change in the program which gave rise to the net countervailable subsidy described in subparagraph (A) has occurred that is likely to affect that net countervailable subsidy.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of other factors</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) programs determined to provide countervailable subsidies in other investigations or reviews under this subtitle, but only to the extent that such programs—</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) can potentially be used by the exporters or producers subject to the review under section 1675(c) of this title, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) did not exist at the time that the countervailing duty order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) programs newly alleged to provide countervailable subsidies but only to the extent that the administering authority makes an affirmative countervailing duty determination with respect to such programs and with respect to the exporters or producers subject to the review.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Net countervailable subsidy</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated.

The administering authority shall consider—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the weighted average dumping margins determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the volume of imports of the subject merchandise for the period before and the period after the issuance of the antidumping duty order or acceptance of the suspension agreement.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of other factors</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider such other price, cost, market, or economic factors as it deems relevant.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Magnitude of the margin of dumping</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the magnitude of the margin of dumping that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated.

authority providing the subsidy, the subsidy is specific.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (5B), any reference to an enterprise or industry is a

activities conducted by a person, or by a higher education or research establishment on a contract basis with a person, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy covers not more than 75 percent of the costs of industrial research or not more than 50 percent of the costs of precompetitive development activity, and such subsidy is limited exclusively to—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the costs of researchers, technicians, and other supporting staff employed exclusively in the research activity,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs of instruments, equipment, land, or buildings that are used exclusively and permanently (except when disposed of on a commercial basis) for the research activity,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III)

research findings into a plan, blueprint, or design for new, modified, or improved products, processes, or services, whether intended for sale or use, including the creation of a first prototype that would not be capable of commercial use. The term also may include the conceptual formulation and design of products, processes, or services alternatives and initial demonstration or pilot projects, if these same projects cannot be converted or used for industrial application or commercial exploitation. The term does not include routine or periodic alterations to existing products, production lines, manufacturing processes, services, or other ongoing operations even if those alterations may represent improvements.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Calculation rules</h4> <h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of a research activity that spans both industrial research and precompetitive development activity, the allowable level of the noncountervailable subsidy shall not exceed 62.5 percent of the costs set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), and (V) of clause (i).</p> <h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Total eligible costs</h4> <p class="statutory-body-4em">The allowable level of a noncountervailable subsidy described in clause (i) shall be based on the total eligible costs incurred over the duration of a particular project.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Subsidy to disadvantaged regions</h4> <h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy provided, pursuant to a general framework of regional development, to a person located in a disadvantaged region within a country shall be treated as noncountervailable, if it is not specific (within the meaning of paragraph (5A)) within eligible regions and if the following conditions are met:</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Each region identified as disadvantaged within the territory of a country is a clearly designated, contiguous geographical area with a definable economic and administrative identity.</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Each region is considered a disadvantaged region on the basis of neutral and objective criteria indicating that the region is disadvantaged because of more than temporary circumstances, and such criteria are clearly stated in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) The criteria described in subclause (II) include a measurement of economic development.</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) Programs provided within a general framework of regional development include ceilings on the amount of assistance that can be granted to a subsidized project. Such ceilings are differentiated according to the different levels of development of assisted regions, and are expressed in terms of investment costs or costs of job creation. Within such ceilings, the distribution of assistance is sufficiently broad and even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or the provision of disproportionately large amounts of a subsidy to, an enterprise or industry as described in paragraph (5A)(D).</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Measurement of economic development</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the measurement of economic development shall be based on one or more of the following factors:</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Per capita income, household per capita income, or per capita gross domestic product that does not exceed 85 percent of the average for the country subject to investigation or review.</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) An unemployment rate that is at least 110 percent of the average unemployment rate for the country subject to investigation or review.</p> <p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">The measurement of economic development shall cover a 3-year period, but may be a composite measurement and may include factors other than those set forth in this clause.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Definitions</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph—</p> <h4 class="subclause-head">(I) General framework of regional development</h4> <p class="statutory-body-4em">The term “general framework of regional development” means that the regional subsidy programs are part of an internally consistent and generally applicable regional development policy, and that regional development subsidies are not granted in isolated geographical points having no, or virtually no, influence on the development of a region.</p> <h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Neutral and objective criteria</h4> <p class="statutory-body-4em">The term “neutral and objective criteria” means criteria that do not favor certain regions beyond what is appropriate for the elimination or reduction of regional disparities within the framework of the regional development policy.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Subsidy for adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements</h4> <h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy that is provided to promote the adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements that are imposed by statute or by regulation, and that result in greater constraints and financial burdens on the recipient of the subsidy, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is a one-time nonrecurring measure,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is limited to 20 percent of the cost of adaptation,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) does not cover the cost of replacing and operating the subsidized investment, a cost that must be fully borne by the recipient,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) is directly linked and proportionate to the recipient's planned reduction of nuisances and pollution, and does not cover any manufacturing cost savings that may be achieved, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) is available to all persons that can adopt the new equipment or production processes.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Existing facilities</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “existing facilities” means facilities that have been in operation for at least 2 years before the date on which the new environmental requirements are imposed.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Notified subsidy program</h4> <h4 class="clause-head">(i) General rule</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">If a subsidy is provided pursuant to a program that has been notified in accordance with Article 8.3 of the Subsidies Agreement, the subsidy shall be treated as noncountervailable and shall not be subject to investigation or review under this subtitle.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding clause (i), a subsidy shall be treated as countervailable if—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that a determination has been made pursuant to Article 8.4 or 8.5 of the Subsidies Agreement that the subsidy, or the program pursuant to which the subsidy was provided, does not satisfy the conditions and criteria of Article 8.2 of the Subsidies Agreement; and</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the subsidy is specific within the meaning of paragraph (5A).</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain subsidies on agricultural products</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">Domestic support measures that are provided with respect to products listed in Annex 1 to the Agreement on Agriculture, and that the administering authority determines conform fully to the provisions of Annex 2 to that Agreement, shall be treated as noncountervailable.

notified to the administering authority.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Net countervailable subsidy</h4> <p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of determining the net countervailable subsidy, the administering authority may subtract from the gross countervailable subsidy the amount of—</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify for, or to receive, the benefit of the countervailable subsidy,</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any loss in the value of the countervailable subsidy resulting from its deferred

consider—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the volume of imports of the subject merchandise,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the effect of imports of that merchandise on prices in the United States for domestic like products, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of domestic like products, but only in the context of production operations within the United States; and</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may consider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination regarding whether there is material injury by reason of imports.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the notification required under section 1671d(d) or 1673d(d) of this title, as the case may be, the Commission shall explain its analysis of each factor considered under clause (i), and identify each factor considered under clause (ii) and explain in full its relevance to the determination.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Evaluation of relevant factors</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (B)—</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(i) Volume</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">In evaluating the volume of imports of merchandise, the Commission shall consider whether the volume of imports of the merchandise, or any increase in that volume, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, is significant.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Price</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">In evaluating the effect of imports of such merchandise on prices, the Commission shall consider whether—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Impact on affected domestic industry</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">In examining the impact required to be considered under subparagraph (B)(i)(III), the Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization of capacity,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) factors affecting domestic prices,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) in a proceeding under part II of this subtitle, the magnitude of the margin of dumping.</p> <p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this clause within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Captive production</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">If domestic producers internally transfer significant production of the domestic like product for the production of a downstream article and sell significant production of the domestic like product in the merchant market, and the Commission finds that—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the domestic like product produced that is internally transferred for processing into that downstream article does not enter the merchant market for the domestic like product,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the domestic like product is the predominant material input in the production of that downstream article, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the production of the domestic like product sold in the merchant market is not generally used in the production of that downstream article,</p> <p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">then the Commission, in determining market share and the factors affecting financial performance set forth in clause (iii), shall focus primarily on the merchant market for the domestic like product.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rules for agricultural products</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The Commission shall not determine that there is no material injury or threat of material injury to United States producers of an agricultural commodity merely because the prevailing market price is at or above the minimum support price.</p> <p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In the case of agricultural products, the Commission shall consider any increased burden on government income or price support programs.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rules</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph—</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(i) Nature of countervailable subsidy</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining whether there is a threat of material injury, the Commission shall consider information provided to it by the administering authority regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy granted by a foreign country (particularly whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement) and the effects likely to be caused by the countervailable subsidy.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Standard for determination</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate under subparagraph (C) or (D) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination by the Commission of material injury.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Threat of material injury</h4> <h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other relevant economic factors—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy (particularly as to whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement), and whether imports of the subject merchandise are likely to increase,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) in any investigation under this subtitle which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(E)(iv)) and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 1671d(b)(1) or 1673d(b)(1) of this title with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both),</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(VIII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(IX) any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time).</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Basis for determination</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall consider the factors set forth in clause (i) as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this subtitle. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under clause (i) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Effect of dumping in third-country markets</h4> <h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-4em">In investigations under part II of this subtitle, the Commission shall consider whether dumping in the markets of foreign countries (as evidenced by dumping findings or antidumping remedies in other WTO member markets against the same class or kind of merchandise manufactured or exported by the same party as under investigation) suggests a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. In the course of its investigation, the Commission shall request information from the foreign manufacturer, exporter, or United States importer concerning this issue.</p> <h4 class="subclause-head">(II) WTO member market</h4> <p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of this clause, the term “WTO member market” means the market of any country which is a WTO member.</p> <h4 class="subclause-head">(III) European Communities</h4> <p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of this clause, the European Communities shall be treated as a foreign country.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Cumulation for determining material injury</h4> <h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (C), and subject to clause (ii), the Commission shall cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title on the same day,</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day, or</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title and investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day,</p> <p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">if such imports compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exceptions</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports under clause (i)—</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) with respect to which the administering authority has made a preliminary negative determination, unless the administering authority subsequently made a final affirmative determination with respect to those imports before the Commission's final determination is made;</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) from any country with respect to which the investigation has been terminated;</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) from any country designated as a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) for purposes of making a determination with respect to that country, except that the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from such country may be cumulatively assessed with imports of the subject merchandise from any other country designated as such a beneficiary country to the extent permitted by clause (i); or</p> <p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) from any country that is a party to an agreement with the United States establishing a free trade area, which entered into force and effect before January 1, 1987, unless the Commission determines that a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from that country.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Records in final investigations</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">In each final determination in which it cumulatively assesses the volume and effect of imports under clause (i), the Commission shall make its determinations based on the record compiled in the first investigation in which it makes a final determination, except that when the administering authority issues its final determination in a subsequently completed investigation, the Commission shall permit the parties in the subsequent investigation to submit comments concerning the significance of the administering authority's final determination, and shall include such comments and the administering authority's final determination in the record for the subsequent investigation.</p> <h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Regional industry determinations</h4> <p class="statutory-body-3em">In an investigation which involves a regional industry, and in which the Commission decides that the volume and effect of imports should be cumulatively assessed under this subparagraph, such assessment shall be based upon the volume and effect of imports into the region or regions determined by the Commission. The provisions of clause (iii) shall apply to such investigations.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Cumulation for determining threat of material injury</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent practicable and subject to subparagraph (G)(ii), for purposes of clause (i)(III) and (IV) of subparagraph (F), the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and price effects of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which—</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title on the same day,</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day, or</p> <p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title and investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day,</p> <p class="statutory-body-block-2em">if such imports compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.</p> <h4 class="subparagraph-head">(I) Consideration of post-petition information</h4> <p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall consider whether any change in the volume, price effects, or impact of imports of the subject merchandise since the filing of the petition in an investigation under part I or II of this subtitle is related to the pendency of the investigation and, if so, the Commission may reduce the weight accorded to the data for the period after the filing of the petition in making its determination of material injury, threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States.</p> <h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Subsidies Agreement;

The monitoring and investigation may include the collection and analysis of information that would expedite an investigation under subsection (b) of this section.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(C) If a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) alleges injury from imports of a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that has been, on the date the allegation is included in the petition, subject to monitoring by the Commission under subparagraph (B) for not less than 90 days; and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to such imports;</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall, not later than the 21st day after the day on which the request was filed, make a determination, on the basis of available information, whether increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the perishable agricultural product or citrus product are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive perishable product or citrus product, and whether either—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the serious injury cannot be timely prevented through investigation under subsection (b) of this section and action under section 2253 of this title.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(D) At the request of the Commission, the Secretary of Agriculture shall promptly provide to the Commission any relevant information that the Department of Agriculture may have for purposes of making determinations and findings under this subsection.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(E) Whenever the Commission makes an affirmative preliminary determination under subparagraph (C), the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(F) The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determination under subparagraph (C) and, if the determination is affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (E).</p> <p class="statutory-body">(G) Within 7 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (F) containing an affirmative determination, the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (E), shall proclaim such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section alleges that critical circumstances exist and requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to imports of the article identified in the petition, the Commission shall, not later than 60 days after the petition containing the request was filed, determine, on the basis of available information, whether—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is clear evidence that increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the article are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article; and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) delay in taking action under this part would cause damage to that industry that would be difficult to repair.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) and, if the determinations are affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (B).</p> <p class="statutory-body">(D) Within 30 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (C) containing an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii), the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (B), shall proclaim, for a period not to exceed 200 days, such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury.
