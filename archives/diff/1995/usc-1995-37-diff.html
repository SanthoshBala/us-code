The amount of the allowance for quarters shall be the same amount that would be payable to the deceased member under sections 403, 403a, and 405 of this title if the member had not died. The payment of an allowance for quarters under this subsection shall terminate 180 days after the date of the member's death.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(m)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a member of a uniformed service who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service and who is authorized a basic allowance for quarters solely by reason of the member's payment of child support, the amount of the basic allowance for quarters to which the member is entitled shall be equal to the difference between the basic allowance for quarters applicable to the member's grade, rank, or rating at the with-dependent rate and the applicable basic allowance for quarters at the without-dependent rate.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service shall not be entitled to a basic allowance for quarters solely by reason of the payment of child support if the monthly rate of that child support is less than the amount of the basic allowance for quarters computed for the member under paragraph (1).</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) The application of this subsection to a member of a uniformed service shall not affect the entitlement of that member to a basic allowance for quarters at a partial rate under section 1009(c) of this title.</p> <p class="source-credit">Pub.

An increase in weight allowance under this subparagraph may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allowance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades O–6 to O–10.

Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs. However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States.

In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate. The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the member is serving on permanent duty at a station outside the United States, in Hawaii or Alaska, or on sea duty.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, transportation for dependents, baggage, and household effects of a member, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, is authorized if he dies while entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member who—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is involuntarily separated from active duty during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990,</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">is, not later than one year from the date he is so retired, placed on that list, involuntarily separated, discharged, or released, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned, entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects to the home selected under section 404(c) of this title, and to a per diem for his dependents. In addition, baggage and household effects may be shipped to a location other than the home selected by the member.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) If baggage and household effects of a member are shipped to a place selected by a member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title or to a location other than the home selected by the member, or if transportation is provided for a member's dependents to a place selected by the member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title, and the costs of that shipment or transportation are in excess of those that would have been incurred if the shipment had been made or the transportation had been provided to a location in the United States (other than Alaska or Hawaii), the member shall pay that excess cost.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(3) If a member authorized to select a home under section 404(c) of this title accrues that right or any entitlement under this subsection but dies before he exercises it, that right or entitlement accrues to and may be exercised by his surviving dependents or, if there are no surviving dependents, his baggage and household effects may be shipped to the home of the person legally entitled to such baggage and effects. However, if baggage and household effects are shipped under circumstances described in paragraph (2) in which the member would have been required to pay the excess costs of that shipment, the surviving dependents or the person legally entitled to the baggage and household effects, as the case may be, shall pay that excess cost.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) If the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the best interests of a member described in paragraph (2) or the member's dependents and the United States, the Secretary may, when orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) authorize the movement of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects at the station to an appropriate location in the United States or its possessions or, if the dependents are foreign nationals, to the country of the dependents’ origin and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof, as the case may be, plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b); and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a member described in paragraph (2)(A), authorize the transportation of one motor vehicle that is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for his dependents’ personal use to that location by means of transportation authorized under section 2634 of title 10.</p> <p class="statutory-body-block">If the member's baggage and household effects are in nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may authorize their movement to the location concerned and prescribe transportation in kind or reimbursement therefor, as authorized under subsection (b).

The allowance is not limited to reimbursement for actual expenses and may be paid in advance of the transportation of the baggage and household effects. However, the amount of the allowance shall provide a savings to the United States when the total cost of the transportation is compared with the cost that would be incurred under subsection (b).</p> <p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may prescribe in any regulations authorizing the payment of a monetary allowance to a member who participates in a program in which the member provides all or a part of the labor in connection with the transportation of the baggage and household effects of the member—</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extent to which payment to the member will be made for such labor, and</p> <p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the manner in which liability will be allocated among the member, the United States, and the common carriers involved in the event of loss of or damage to any baggage or household effects packed, crated, or loaded by the member.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(l) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member with dependents who is ordered to make an overseas permanent change of station and who, in anticipation of his dependents accompanying him overseas, ships baggage and household effects to that overseas station, may be authorized a return shipment of the baggage and household effects if, after the shipment, the member's dependents are unable to accompany him overseas and the Secretary concerned determines that such inability was unexpected and uncontrollable.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(m) For the purposes of this section, the residence of a dependent of a member who is a student not living with the member while at school shall be considered to be the permanent duty station of the member or the designated residence of dependents of the member if the member's dependents are not authorized to reside with the member.</p> <p class="statutory-body">(n) No carrier, port agent, warehouseman, freight forwarder, or other person involved in the transportation of property may have any lien on, or hold, impound, or otherwise interfere with, the movement of baggage and household goods being transported under this section.</p> <p class="source-credit">Pub.
