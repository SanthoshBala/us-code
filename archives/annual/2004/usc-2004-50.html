<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter IV&#8212;Communist Control</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;841 &#183; Findings and declarations of fact</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that the Communist Party of the United States, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States. It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship within a republic, demanding for itself the rights and privileges accorded to political parties, but denying to all others the liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. Unlike political parties, which evolve their policies and programs through public means, by the reconciliation of a wide variety of individual views, and submit those policies and programs to the electorate at large for approval or disapproval, the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders of the world Communist movement. Its members have no part in determining its goals, and are not permitted to voice dissent to party objectives. Unlike members of political parties, members of the Communist Party are recruited for indoctrination with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and disciplined to carry into action slavishly the assignments given them by their hierarchical chieftains. Unlike political parties, the Communist Party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations upon its conduct or upon that of its members. The Communist Party is relatively small numerically, and gives scant indication of capacity ever to attain its ends by lawful political means. The peril inherent in its operation arises not from its numbers, but from its failure to acknowledge any limitation as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence. Holding that doctrine, its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States. It is the means whereby individuals are seduced into the service of the world Communist movement, trained to do its bidding, and directed and controlled in the conspiratorial performance of their revolutionary services. Therefore, the Communist Party should be outlawed.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The security of the United States is and will continue to depend on the ability of the United States to exercise international leadership.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The ability of the United States to exercise international leadership is, and will increasingly continue to be, based on the political and economic strength of the United States, as well as on United States military strength around the world.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Recent changes in the world pose threats of a new kind to international stability as Cold War tensions continue to decline while economic competition, regional conflicts, terrorist activities, and weapon proliferations have dramatically increased.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The future national security and economic well-being of the United States will depend substantially on the ability of its citizens to communicate and compete by knowing the languages and cultures of other countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Federal Government has an interest in ensuring that the employees of its departments and agencies with national security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges of this changing international environment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Federal Government also has an interest in taking actions to alleviate the problem of American undergraduate and graduate students being inadequately prepared to meet the challenges posed by increasing global interaction among nations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) American colleges and universities must place a new emphasis on improving the teaching of foreign languages, area studies, counterproliferation studies, and other international fields to help meet those challenges.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purposes</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To provide the necessary resources, accountability, and flexibility to meet the national security education needs of the United States, especially as such needs change over time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To increase the quantity, diversity, and quality of the teaching and learning of subjects in the fields of foreign languages, area studies, counterproliferation studies, and other international fields that are critical to the Nation's interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To produce an increased pool of applicants for work in the departments and agencies of the United States Government with national security responsibilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To expand, in conjunction with other Federal programs, the international experience, knowledge base, and perspectives on which the United States citizenry, Government employees, and leaders rely.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To permit the Federal Government to advocate the cause of international education.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such former spouse elects to receive this survivor annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which such former spouse may be entitled under subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5, or under another retirement system for Government employees by reason of the remarriage; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">After a qualified former spouse of a retired employee remarries before becoming age 55 or dies, the reduction in the retired employee's annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for such former spouse shall be terminated.

The annuitant making such election shall pay a deposit in accordance with the provisions of section 8418 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if applicable&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 50 percent of the employee's annuity under chapter 84 of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees&#8217; Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title), plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the survivor benefits referred to in subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee's total creditable service after such effective date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">An employee may not make an election or modification of election under section 8417 or 8418 of title 5, or other section relating to the employee's annuity under subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5, that would diminish the entitlement of a qualified former spouse to any benefit granted to such former spouse by this section or by court order or spousal agreement.</p>

<h3 class="chapter-head">Chapter 40. Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2301 &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and technologies are increasingly available from worldwide sources. Technical information relating to such weapons is readily available on the Internet, and raw materials for chemical, biological, and radiological weapons are widely available for legitimate commercial purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain the facilities, materials, and technologies capable of producing additional quantities of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems, deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related materials and technologies, economic hardships, and significant gaps in border control among the states of the former Soviet Union. The problems of organized crime and corruption in the states of the former Soviet Union increase the potential for proliferation of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons and related materials.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons of mass destruction and related materials and technologies from within the states of the former Soviet Union and from unemployed scientists who worked on those programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is greater than at any time in history.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and Libya as hostile states which already possess some weapons of mass destruction and are developing others.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons of mass destruction is well within the capability of many extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or as proxies for foreign states.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with plausible deniability.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical attacks against civilian targets in the United States and Japan, and a radiological attack in Russia.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The potential for the national security of the United States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological terrorism must be taken seriously.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military targets in the usual sense of the term.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons delivered by unconventional means is significant and growing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Facilities required for production of radiological, biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder to detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological and chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery means other than long-range ballistic missiles.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons include cargo ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and private vehicles and vessels, and commercial cargo shipments routed through multiple destinations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons production programs, but are ineffective in monitoring and controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous, unconventional proliferation efforts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do little to detect or prevent the rapid development of a capability to suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical or biological weapons with nothing but commercial supplies and equipment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) The United States lacks adequate planning and countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical terrorism.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear or radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to deal with emergencies involving biological or chemical weapons or related materials.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) State and local emergency response personnel are not adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(22) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe problems of coordination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(23) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States requires well-coordinated participation of many Federal agencies, and careful planning by the Federal Government and State and local governments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(24) Training and exercises can significantly improve the preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel for emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical weapons or related materials.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(25) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive ordnance, as well as radiological, biological, and chemical materials, can be a vital contribution to the development and deployment of countermeasures against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(26) The United States lacks effective policy coordination regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the independent states of the former Soviet Union have achieved important results in ensuring that weapons of mass destruction, weapons-usable material and technology, and weapons-related knowledge remain beyond the reach of terrorists and weapons-proliferating states;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) although these efforts are in the United States national security interest, the effectiveness of these efforts has suffered from a lack of coordination within and among United States Government agencies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) increased spending and investment by the United States private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and investment by the United States private sector in job creation initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian Federation weapons scientists and technicians, are making an important contribution in ensuring that knowledge related to weapons of mass destruction remains beyond the reach of terrorists and weapons-proliferating states; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increased spending and investment by the United States private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent states of the former Soviet Union make advisable the establishment of a coordinating body to ensure that United States public and private efforts are not in conflict, and to ensure that public spending on efforts by the independent states of the former Soviet Union is maximized to ensure efficiency and further United States national security interests.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2527 &#183; Nuclear test ban readiness program</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) On September 17, 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union announced that they would resume full-scale, stage-by-stage negotiations on issues relating to nuclear testing, including further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing leading to the ultimate objective of a comprehensive nuclear test ban.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It was agreed that the first step in these negotiations would be to reach agreement on verification measures that will make possible the ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To achieve the agreement on verification measures, the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to design and conduct a Joint Verification Experiment at the test sites of each country during the summer of 1988.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) At the Moscow summit in May 1988, President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev reaffirmed their commitment to negotiations on &#8220;effective verification measures which will make it possible to ratify the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, and proceed to negotiating further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing leading to the ultimate objective of the complete cessation of nuclear testing as part of an effective disarmament process&#8221;.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall establish and support a program to assure that the United States is in a position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive ban on nuclear explosives testing is negotiated and ratified within the framework agreed to by the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purposes of program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the program under subsection (b) shall be the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To assure that the United States maintains a vigorous program of stockpile inspection and non-explosive testing so that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban is entered into, the United States remains able to detect and identify potential problems in stockpile reliability and safety in existing designs of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To assure that the specific materials, components, processes, and personnel needed for the remanufacture of existing nuclear weapons or the substitution of alternative nuclear warheads are available to support such remanufacture or substitution if such action becomes necessary in order to satisfy reliability and safety requirements under a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To assure that a vigorous program of research in areas related to nuclear weapons science and engineering is supported so that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban agreement is entered into, the United States is able to maintain a base of technical knowledge about nuclear weapons design and nuclear weapons effects.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conduct of program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall carry out the program provided for in subsection (b). The program shall be carried out with the participation of representatives of the Department of Defense, the nuclear weapons production facilities, and the national nuclear weapons laboratories.</p>
