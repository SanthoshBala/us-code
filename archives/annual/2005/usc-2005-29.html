<p class="statutory-body">Whereas under prevailing economic conditions, developed with the aid of governmental authority for owners of property to organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; therefore, the following definitions of and limitations upon the jurisdiction and authority of the courts of the United States are enacted.</p>

Such a temporary restraining order shall be effective for no longer than five days and shall become void at the expiration of said five days. No temporary restraining order or temporary injunction shall be issued except on condition that complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate security in an amount to be fixed by the court sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss, expense, or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction, including all reasonable costs (together with a reasonable attorney's fee) and expense of defense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the court.</p>

<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter II&#8212;National Labor Relations</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;151 &#183; Findings and declaration of policy</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (a) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (b) occurring in the current of commerce; (c) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods from or into the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (d) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing from or into the channels of commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment, or interruption, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, by encouraging practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and by restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Experience has further demonstrated that certain practices by some labor organizations, their officers, and members have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by preventing the free flow of goods in such commerce through strikes and other forms of industrial unrest or through concerted activities which impair the interest of the public in the free flow of such commerce. The elimination of such practices is a necessary condition to the assurance of the rights herein guaranteed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Provided, That nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to make unlawful a refusal by any person to enter upon the premises of any employer (other than his own employer), if the employees of such employer are engaged in a strike ratified or approved by a representative of such employees whom such employer is required to recognize under this subchapter: Provided further, That for the purposes of this paragraph (4) only, nothing contained in such paragraph shall be construed to prohibit publicity, other than picketing, for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers and members of a labor organization, that a product or products are produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute and are distributed by another employer, as long as such publicity does not have an effect of inducing any individual employed by any person other than the primary employer in the course of his employment to refuse to pick up, deliver, or transport any goods, or not to perform any services, at the establishment of the employer engaged in such distribution;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Obligation to bargain collectively</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession: Provided, That where there is in effect a collective-bargaining contract covering employees in an industry affecting commerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) serves a written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification sixty days prior to the expiration date thereof, or in the event such contract contains no expiration date, sixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) continues in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lock-out, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The duties imposed upon employers, employees, and labor organizations by paragraphs (2) to (4) of this subsection shall become inapplicable upon an intervening certification of the Board, under which the labor organization or individual, which is a party to the contract, has been superseded as or ceased to be the representative of the employees subject to the provisions of section 159(a) of this title, and the duties so imposed shall not be construed as requiring either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period, if such modification is to become effective before such terms and conditions can be reopened under the provisions of the contract. Any employee who engages in a strike within any notice period specified in this subsection, or who engages in any strike within the appropriate period specified in subsection (g) of this section, shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute, for the purposes of sections 158, 159, and 160 of this title, but such loss of status for such employee shall terminate if and when he is reemployed by such employer. Whenever the collective bargaining involves employees of a health care institution, the provisions of this subsection shall be modified as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The notice of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be ninety days; the notice of paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be sixty days; and the contract period of paragraph (4) of this subsection shall be ninety days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) After notice is given to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service under either clause (A) or (B) of this sentence, the Service shall promptly communicate with the parties and use its best efforts, by mediation and conciliation, to bring them to agreement. The parties shall participate fully and promptly in such meetings as may be undertaken by the Service for the purpose of aiding in a settlement of the dispute.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforceability of contract or agreement to boycott any other employer; exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such extent unenforcible&#160;Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall apply to an agreement between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work: Provided further, That for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b)(4)(B) of this section the terms &#8220;any employer&#8221;, &#8220;any person engaged in commerce or an industry affecting commerce&#8221;, and &#8220;any person&#8221; when used in relation to the terms &#8220;any other producer, processor, or manufacturer&#8221;, &#8220;any other employer&#8221;, or &#8220;any other person&#8221; shall not include persons in the relation of a jobber, manufacturer, contractor, or subcontractor working on the goods or premises of the jobber or manufacturer or performing parts of an integrated process of production in the apparel and clothing industry: Provided further, That nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the enforcement of any agreement which is within the foregoing exception.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agreement covering employees in the building and construction industry</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall not be an unfair labor practice under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or who, upon their employment, will be engaged) in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in subsection (a) of this section as an unfair labor practice) because (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of section 159 of this title prior to the making of such agreement, or (2) such agreement requires as a condition of employment, membership in such labor organization after the seventh day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of the agreement, whichever is later, or (3) such agreement requires the employer to notify such labor organization of opportunities for employment with such employer, or gives such labor organization an opportunity to refer qualified applicants for such employment, or (4) such agreement specifies minimum training or experience qualifications for employment or provides for priority in opportunities for employment based upon length of service with such employer, in the industry or in the particular geographical area: Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall set aside the final proviso to subsection (a)(3) of this section: Provided further, That any agreement which would be invalid, but for clause (1) of this subsection, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to section 159(c) or 159(e) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Notification of intention to strike or picket at any health care institution</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A labor organization before engaging in any strike, picketing, or other concerted refusal to work at any health care institution shall, not less than ten days prior to such action, notify the institution in writing and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of that intention, except that in the case of bargaining for an initial agreement following certification or recognition the notice required by this subsection shall not be given until the expiration of the period specified in clause (B) of the last sentence of subsection (d) of this section. The notice shall state the date and time that such action will commence. The notice, once given, may be extended by the written agreement of both parties.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of bargaining unit by Board</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall decide in each case whether, in order to assure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this subchapter, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof: Provided, That the Board shall not (1) decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit; or (2) decide that any craft unit is inappropriate for such purposes on the ground that a different unit has been established by a prior Board determination, unless a majority of the employees in the proposed craft unit vote against separate representation or (3) decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes if it includes, together with other employees, any individual employed as a guard to enforce against employees and other persons rules to protect property of the employer or to protect the safety of persons on the employer's premises; but no labor organization shall be certified as the representative of employees in a bargaining unit of guards if such organization admits to membership, or is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which admits to membership, employees other than guards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by an employer, alleging that one or more individuals or labor organizations have presented to him a claim to be recognized as the representative defined in subsection (a) of this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Board shall investigate such petition and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation affecting commerce exists shall provide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice. Such hearing may be conducted by an officer or employee of the regional office, who shall not make any recommendations with respect thereto.

<p class="statutory-body">The Board is empowered, as hereinafter provided, to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 158 of this title) affecting commerce. This power shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, law, or otherwise: Provided, That the Board is empowered by agreement with any agency of any State or Territory to cede to such agency jurisdiction over any cases in any industry (other than mining, manufacturing, communications, and transportation except where predominantly local in character) even though such cases may involve labor disputes affecting commerce, unless the provision of the State or Territorial statute applicable to the determination of such cases by such agency is inconsistent with the corresponding provision of this subchapter or has received a construction inconsistent therewith.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Complaint and notice of hearing; answer; court rules of evidence inapplicable</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the Board, or any agent or agency designated by the Board for such purposes, shall have power to issue and cause to be served upon such person a complaint stating the charges in that respect, and containing a notice of hearing before the Board or a member thereof, or before a designated agent or agency, at a place therein fixed, not less than five days after the serving of said complaint: Provided, That no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom such charge is made, unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing such charge by reason of service in the armed forces, in which event the six-month period shall be computed from the day of his discharge. Any such complaint may be amended by the member, agent, or agency conducting the hearing or the Board in its discretion at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon. The person so complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the original or amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. In the discretion of the member, agent, or agency conducting the hearing or the Board, any other person may be allowed to intervene in the said proceeding and to present testimony. Any such proceeding shall, so far as practicable, be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of the United States under the rules of civil procedure for the district courts of the United States, adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States pursuant to section 2072 of title 28.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduction of testimony to writing; findings and orders of Board</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The testimony taken by such member, agent, or agency or the Board shall be reduced to writing and filed with the Board. Thereafter, in its discretion, the Board upon notice may take further testimony or hear argument. If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the Board shall be of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this subchapter: Provided, That where an order directs reinstatement of an employee, back pay may be required of the employer or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the discrimination suffered by him: And provided further, That in determining whether a complaint shall issue alleging a violation of subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of section 158 of this title, and in deciding such cases, the same regulations and rules of decision shall apply irrespective of whether or not the labor organization affected is affiliated with a labor organization national or international in scope. Such order may further require such person to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which it has complied with the order. If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the Board shall not be of the opinion that the person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the said complaint. No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause. In case the evidence is presented before a member of the Board, or before an administrative law judge or judges thereof, such member, or such judge or judges as the case may be, shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding a proposed report, together with a recommended order, which shall be filed with the Board, and if no exceptions are filed within twenty days after service thereof upon such parties, or within such further period as the Board may authorize, such recommended order shall become the order of the Board and become effective as therein prescribed.</p>

Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board. No objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, and to be made a part of the record. The Board may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. Upon the filing of the record with it the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the appropriate United States court of appeals if application was made to the district court as hereinabove provided, and by the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Review of final order of Board on petition to court</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order in any United States court of appeals in the circuit wherein the unfair labor practice in question was alleged to have been engaged in or wherein such person resides or transacts business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such a court a written petition praying that the order of the Board be modified or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Board, and thereupon the aggrieved party shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, certified by the Board, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the Board under subsection (e) of this section, and shall have the same jurisdiction to grant to the Board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and in like manner to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board; the findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall in like manner be conclusive.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Institution of court proceedings as stay of Board's order</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The commencement of proceedings under subsection (e) or (f) of this section shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Board's order.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Jurisdiction of courts unaffected by limitations prescribed in chapter 6 of this title</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">When granting appropriate temporary relief or a restraining order, or making and entering a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified or setting aside in whole or in part an order of the Board, as provided in this section, the jurisdiction of courts sitting in equity shall not be limited by chapter 6 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that the existence, in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (1) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce. That Congress further finds that the employment of persons in domestic service in households affects commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is declared to be the policy of this chapter, through the exercise by Congress of its power to regulate commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, to correct and as rapidly as practicable to eliminate the conditions above referred to in such industries without substantially curtailing employment or earning power.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;208 &#183; Wage orders in American Samoa</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional policy; recommendation of wage rate by industry committee</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The policy of this chapter with respect to industries or enterprises in American Samoa engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce is to reach as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment the objective of the minimum wage rate which would apply in each such industry under paragraph (1) or (5) of section 206(a) of this title but for section 206(c)&#160;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigation of industry condition by industry committee; matters considered</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the convening of any such industry committee, the Administrator shall refer to it the question of the minimum wage rate or rates to be fixed for such industry. The industry committee shall investigate conditions in the industry and the committee, or any authorized subcommittee thereof, shall after due notice hear such witnesses and receive such evidence as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the committee to perform its duties and functions under this chapter. The committee shall recommend to the Administrator the highest minimum wage rates for the industry which it determines, having due regard to economic and competitive conditions, will not substantially curtail employment in the industry, and will not give any industry in American Samoa a competitive advantage over any industry in the United States outside of American Samoa; except that the committee shall recommend to the Secretary the minimum wage rate prescribed in section 206(a) or 206(b) of this title, which would be applicable but for section 206(a)(3) of this title, unless there is evidence in the record which establishes that the industry, or a predominant portion thereof, is unable to pay that wage due to such economic and competitive conditions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Classifications within industry; recommendation of wage rate</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The industry committee shall recommend such reasonable classifications within any industry as it determines to be necessary for the purpose of fixing for each classification within such industry the highest minimum wage rate (not in excess of that in effect under paragraph (1) or (5) of section 206(a) of this title (as the case may be)) which (1) will not substantially curtail employment in such classification and (2) will not give a competitive advantage to any group in the industry, and shall recommend for each classification in the industry the highest minimum wage rate which the committee determines will not substantially curtail employment in such classification. In determining whether such classification should be made in any industry, in making such classifications, and in determining the minimum wage rates for such classifications, no classifications shall be made, and no minimum wage rate shall be fixed, solely on a regional basis, but the industry committee shall consider among other relevant factors the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) competitive conditions as affected by transportation, living, and production costs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the wages established for work of like or comparable character by collective labor agreements negotiated between employers and employees by representatives of their own choosing; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the wages paid for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum wage standards in the industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">No classification shall be made under this section on the basis of age or sex.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report by industry committee; publication in Federal Register</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The industry committee shall file with the Secretary a report containing its findings of fact and recommendations with respect to the matters referred to it. Upon the filing of such report, the Secretary shall publish such recommendations in the Federal Register and shall provide by order that the recommendations contained in such report shall take effect upon the expiration of 15 days after the date of such publication.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Orders</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Orders issued under this section shall define the industries and classifications therein to which they are to apply, and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Administrator finds necessary to carry out the purposes of such orders, to prevent the circumvention or evasion thereof, and to safeguard the minimum wage rates established therein.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Due notice of hearings by publication in Federal Register</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Due notice of any hearing provided for in this section shall be given by publication in the Federal Register and by such other means as the Administrator deems reasonably calculated to give general notice to interested persons.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any person aggrieved by an order of the Secretary issued under section 208 of this title may obtain a review of such order in the United States Court of Appeals for any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within 60 days after the entry of such order a written petition praying that the order of the Secretary be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of such petition shall forthwith be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary, and thereupon the Secretary shall file in the court the record of the industry committee upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify (including provision for the payment of an appropriate minimum wage rate), or set aside such order in whole or in part, so far as it is applicable to the petitioner. The review by the court shall be limited to questions of law, and findings of fact by such industry committee when supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive. No objection to the order of the Secretary shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before such industry committee or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence may materially affect the result of the proceeding and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceedings before such industry committee, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before an industry committee and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. Such industry committee may modify the initial findings by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and shall file with the court such modified or new findings which if supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive, and shall also file its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The commencement of proceedings under subsection (a) of this section shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Administrator's order. The court shall not grant any stay of the order unless the person complaining of such order shall file in court an undertaking with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the court for the payment to the employees affected by the order, in the event such order is affirmed, of the amount by which the compensation such employees are entitled to receive under the order exceeds the compensation they actually receive while such stay is in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, to the extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, shall by regulations or by orders provide for the employment of learners, of apprentices, and of messengers employed primarily in delivering letters and messages, under special certificates issued pursuant to regulations of the Secretary, at such wages lower than the minimum wage applicable under section 206 of this title and subject to such limitations as to time, number, proportion, and length of service as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Students</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary, to the extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, shall by special certificate issued under a regulation or order provide, in accordance with subparagraph (B), for the employment, at a wage rate not less than 85 per centum of the otherwise applicable wage rate in effect under section 206 of this title or not less than $1.60 an hour, whichever is the higher, of full-time students (regardless of age but in compliance with applicable child labor laws) in retail or service establishments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in paragraph (4)(B), during any month in which full-time students are to be employed in any retail or service establishment under certificates issued under this subsection the proportion of student hours of employment to the total hours of employment of all employees in such establishment may not exceed&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the maximum proportion for any corresponding month of student hours of employment to the total hours of employment of all employees in such establishment applicable to the issuance of certificates under this section at any time before the effective date of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 for the employment of students by such employer, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) a proportion equal to one-tenth of the total hours of employment of all employees in such establishment,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">whichever is greater;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of retail or service establishment whose employees (other than employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce) are covered for the first time on or after the effective date of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974&#8212;</p>

The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe standards and requirements to insure that this paragraph will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those to whom the minimum wage rate authorized by this paragraph is applicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A special certificate issued under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall provide that the student or students for whom it is issued shall, except during vacation periods, be employed on a part-time basis and not in excess of twenty hours in any workweek.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the issuance of a special certificate under paragraph (1) or (2) for an employer will cause the number of students employed by such employer under special certificates issued under this subsection to exceed six, the Secretary may not issue such a special certificate for the employment of a student by such employer unless the Secretary finds employment of such student will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those employed under special certificates issued under this subsection. If the issuance of a special certificate under paragraph (1) or (2) for an employer will not cause the number of students employed by such employer under special certificates issued under this subsection to exceed six&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary may issue a special certificate under paragraph (1) or (2) for the employment of a student by such employer if such employer certifies to the Secretary that the employment of such student will not reduce the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those employed under special certificates issued under this subsection, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of an employer which is a retail or service establishment, subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the issuance of special certificates for such employer under such paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The requirement of this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of the issuance of special certificates under paragraph (3) for the employment of full-time students by institutions of higher education; except that if the Secretary determines that an institution of higher education is employing students under certificates issued under paragraph (3) but in violation of the requirements of that paragraph or of regulations issued thereunder, the requirements of this subparagraph shall apply with respect to the issuance of special certificates under paragraph (3) for the employment of students by such institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) No special certificate may be issued under this subsection unless the employer for whom the certificate is to be issued provides evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of the student status of the employees to be employed under such special certificate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) To minimize paperwork for, and to encourage, small businesses to employ students under special certificates issued under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall, by regulation or order, prescribe a simplified application form to be used by employers in applying for such a certificate for the employment of not more than six full-time students. Such an application shall require only&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a listing of the name, address, and business of the applicant employer,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a listing of the date the applicant began business, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the certification that the employment of such full-time students will not reduce the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than persons employed under special certificates.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Handicapped workers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, to the extent necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, shall by regulation or order provide for the employment, under special certificates, of individuals (including individuals employed in agriculture) whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury, at wages which are&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) lower than the minimum wage applicable under section 206 of this title,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) commensurate with those paid to nonhandicapped workers, employed in the vicinity in which the individuals under the certificates are employed, for essentially the same type, quality, and quantity of work, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) related to the individual's productivity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall not issue a certificate under paragraph (1) unless the employer provides written assurances to the Secretary that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of individuals paid on an hourly rate basis, wages paid in accordance with paragraph (1) will be reviewed by the employer at periodic intervals at least once every six months, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) wages paid in accordance with paragraph (1) will be adjusted by the employer at periodic intervals, at least once each year, to reflect changes in the prevailing wage paid to experienced nonhandicapped individuals employed in the locality for essentially the same type of work.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), no employer shall be permitted to reduce the hourly wage rate prescribed by certificate under this subsection in effect on June 1, 1986, of any handicapped individual for a period of two years from such date without prior authorization of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit an employer from maintaining or establishing work activities centers to provide therapeutic activities for handicapped clients.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, any employee receiving a special minimum wage at a rate specified pursuant to this subsection or the parent or guardian of such an employee may petition the Secretary to obtain a review of such special minimum wage rate. An employee or the employee's parent or guardian may file such a petition for and in behalf of the employee or in behalf of the employee and other employees similarly situated. No employee may be a party to any such action unless the employee or the employee's parent or guardian gives consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed with the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon receipt of a petition filed in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Secretary within ten days shall assign the petition to an administrative law judge appointed pursuant to section 3105 of title 5. The administrative law judge shall conduct a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5 with respect to such petition within thirty days after assignment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any such proceeding, the employer shall have the burden of demonstrating that the special minimum wage rate is justified as necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) In determining whether any special minimum wage rate is justified pursuant to subparagraph (C), the administrative law judge shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the productivity of the employee or employees identified in the petition and the conditions under which such productivity was measured; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the productivity of other employees performing work of essentially the same type and quality for other employers in the same vicinity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) The administrative law judge shall issue a decision within thirty days after the hearing provided for in subparagraph (B). Such action shall be deemed to be a final agency action unless within thirty days the Secretary grants a request to review the decision of the administrative law judge. Either the petitioner or the employer may request review by the Secretary within fifteen days of the date of issuance of the decision by the administrative law judge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Secretary, within thirty days after receiving a request for review, shall review the record and either adopt the decision of the administrative law judge or issue exceptions. The decision of the administrative law judge, together with any exceptions, shall be deemed to be a final agency action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G) A final agency action shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 7 of title 5. An action seeking such review shall be brought within thirty days of a final agency action described in subparagraph (F).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by regulation or order provide that sections 206 and 207 of this title shall not apply with respect to the employment by any elementary or secondary school of its students if such employment constitutes, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an integral part of the regular education program provided by such school and such employment is in accordance with applicable child labor laws.</p>

Any employer who violates the provisions of section 215(a)(3) of this title shall be liable for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of section 215(a)(3) of this title, including without limitation employment, reinstatement, promotion, and the payment of wages lost and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages. An action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated. No employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought. The court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney's fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action. The right provided by this subsection to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee, and the right of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action, shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary of Labor in an action under section 217 of this title in which (1) restraint is sought of any further delay in the payment of unpaid minimum wages, or the amount of unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, owing to such employee under section 206 or section 207 of this title by an employer liable therefor under the provisions of this subsection or (2) legal or equitable relief is sought as a result of alleged violations of section 215(a)(3) of this title.</p>

The Secretary may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation and an equal amount as liquidated damages. The right provided by subsection (b) of this section to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee to recover the liability specified in the first sentence of such subsection and of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary in an action under this subsection in which a recovery is sought of unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under sections 206 and 207 of this title or liquidated or other damages provided by this subsection owing to such employee by an employer liable under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, unless such action is dismissed without prejudice on motion of the Secretary. Any sums thus recovered by the Secretary of Labor on behalf of an employee pursuant to this subsection shall be held in a special deposit account and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary of Labor, directly to the employee or employees affected. Any such sums not paid to an employee because of inability to do so within a period of three years shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;251 &#183; Congressional findings and declaration of policy</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended [29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], has been interpreted judicially in disregard of long-established customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees, thereby creating wholly unexpected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation, upon employers with the results that, if said Act as so interpreted or claims arising under such interpretations were permitted to stand, (1) the payment of such liabilities would bring about financial ruin of many employers and seriously impair the capital resources of many others, thereby resulting in the reduction of industrial operations, halting of expansion and development, curtailing employment, and the earning power of employees; (2) the credit of many employers would be seriously impaired; (3) there would be created both an extended and continuous uncertainty on the part of industry, both employer and employee, as to the financial condition of productive establishments and a gross inequality of competitive conditions between employers and between industries; (4) employees would receive windfall payments, including liquidated damages, of sums for activities performed by them without any expectation of reward beyond that included in their agreed rates of pay; (5) there would occur the promotion of increasing demands for payment to employees for engaging in activities no compensation for which had been contemplated by either the employer or employee at the time they were engaged in; (6) voluntary collective bargaining would be interfered with and industrial disputes between employees and employers and between employees and employees would be created; (7) the courts of the country would be burdened with excessive and needless litigation and champertous practices would be encouraged; (8) the Public Treasury would be deprived of large sums of revenues and public finances would be seriously deranged by claims against the Public Treasury for refunds of taxes already paid; (9) the cost to the Government of goods and services heretofore and hereafter purchased by its various departments and agencies would be unreasonably increased and the Public Treasury would be seriously affected by consequent increased cost of war contracts; and (10) serious and adverse effects upon the revenues of Federal, State, and local governments would occur.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that all of the foregoing constitutes a substantial burden on commerce and a substantial obstruction to the free flow of goods in commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that it is in the national public interest and for the general welfare, essential to national defense, and necessary to aid, protect, and foster commerce, that this chapter be enacted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that the varying and extended periods of time for which, under the laws of the several States, potential retroactive liability may be imposed upon employers, have given and will give rise to great difficulties in the sound and orderly conduct of business and industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds and declares that all of the results which have arisen or may arise under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, as aforesaid, may (except as to liability for liquidated damages) arise with respect to the Walsh-Healey [41 U.S.C. 35 et seq.] and Bacon-Davis&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in order to meet the existing emergency and to correct existing evils (1) to relieve and protect interstate commerce from practices which burden and obstruct it; (2) to protect the right of collective bargaining; and (3) to define and limit the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;401 &#183; Congressional declaration of findings, purposes, and policy</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Standards for labor-management relations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that, in the public interest, it continues to be the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect employees&#8217; rights to organize, choose their own representatives, bargain collectively, and otherwise engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection; that the relations between employers and labor organizations and the millions of workers they represent have a substantial impact on the commerce of the Nation; and that in order to accomplish the objective of a free flow of commerce it is essential that labor organizations, employers, and their officials adhere to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of their organizations, particularly as they affect labor-management relations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of rights of employees and the public</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally as they relate to the activities of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Necessity to eliminate or prevent improper practices</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that the enactment of this chapter is necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives which distort and defeat the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended [29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.], and the Railway Labor Act, as amended [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and have the tendency or necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (1) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (2) occurring in the current of commerce; (3) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods into or from the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (4) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing into or from the channels of commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the face of rising productivity and affluence, older workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment when displaced from jobs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the setting of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance has become a common practice, and certain otherwise desirable practices may work to the disadvantage of older persons;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment with resultant deterioration of skill, morale, and employer acceptability is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers; their numbers are great and growing; and their employment problems grave;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the existence in industries affecting commerce, of arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age, burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) undertake research, and promote research, with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older persons, and the promotion of measures for utilizing their skills;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish and otherwise make available to employers, professional societies, the various media of communication, and other interested persons the findings of studies and other materials for the promotion of employment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) sponsor and assist State and community informational and educational programs.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;655 &#183; Standards</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Promulgation by Secretary of national consensus standards and established Federal standards; time for promulgation; conflicting standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Without regard to chapter 5 of title 5 or to the other subsections of this section, the Secretary shall, as soon as practicable during the period beginning with the effective date of this chapter and ending two years after such date, by rule promulgate as an occupational safety or health standard any national consensus standard, and any established Federal standard, unless he determines that the promulgation of such a standard would not result in improved safety or health for specifically designated employees. In the event of conflict among any such standards, the Secretary shall promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedure for promulgation, modification, or revocation of standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by rule promulgate, modify, or revoke any occupational safety or health standard in the following manner:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Secretary, upon the basis of information submitted to him in writing by an interested person, a representative of any organization of employers or employees, a nationally recognized standards-producing organization, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or a State or political subdivision, or on the basis of information developed by the Secretary or otherwise available to him, determines that a rule should be promulgated in order to serve the objectives of this chapter, the Secretary may request the recommendations of an advisory committee appointed under section 656 of this title. The Secretary shall provide such an advisory committee with any proposals of his own or of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, together with all pertinent factual information developed by the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or otherwise available, including the results of research, demonstrations, and experiments. An advisory committee shall submit to the Secretary its recommendations regarding the rule to be promulgated within ninety days from the date of its appointment or within such longer or shorter period as may be prescribed by the Secretary, but in no event for a period which is longer than two hundred and seventy days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall publish a proposed rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard in the Federal Register and shall afford interested persons a period of thirty days after publication to submit written data or comments. Where an advisory committee is appointed and the Secretary determines that a rule should be issued, he shall publish the proposed rule within sixty days after the submission of the advisory committee's recommendations or the expiration of the period prescribed by the Secretary for such submission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) On or before the last day of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), any interested person may file with the Secretary written objections to the proposed rule, stating the grounds therefor and requesting a public hearing on such objections. Within thirty days after the last day for filing such objections, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice specifying the occupational safety or health standard to which objections have been filed and a hearing requested, and specifying a time and place for such hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within sixty days after the expiration of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), or within sixty days after the completion of any hearing held under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall issue a rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard or make a determination that a rule should not be issued. Such a rule may contain a provision delaying its effective date for such period (not in excess of ninety days) as the Secretary determines may be necessary to insure that affected employers and employees will be informed of the existence of the standard and of its terms and that employers affected are given an opportunity to familiarize themselves and their employees with the existence of the requirements of the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Any employer may apply to the Secretary for a temporary order granting a variance from a standard or any provision thereof promulgated under this section. Such temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of clause (B) and establishes that (i) he is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date, (ii) he is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and (iii) he has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard as quickly as practicable. Any temporary order issued under this paragraph shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail his program for coming into compliance with the standard. Such a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing: Provided, That the Secretary may issue one interim order to be effective until a decision is made on the basis of the hearing. No temporary order may be in effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve compliance with the standard or one year, whichever is shorter, except that such an order may be renewed not more than twice (I) so long as the requirements of this paragraph are met and (II) if an application for renewal is filed at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the order. No interim renewal of an order may remain in effect for longer than 180 days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) An application for a temporary order under this paragraph (6) shall contain:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a specification of the standard or portion thereof from which the employer seeks a variance,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons having firsthand knowledge of the facts represented, that he is unable to comply with the standard or portion thereof and a detailed statement of the reasons therefor,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a statement of the steps he has taken and will take (with specific dates) to protect employees against the hazard covered by the standard,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a statement of when he expects to be able to comply with the standard and what steps he has taken and what steps he will take (with dates specified) to come into compliance with the standard, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) a certification that he has informed his employees of the application by giving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted, and by other appropriate means.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">A description of how employees have been informed shall be contained in the certification. The information to employees shall also inform them of their right to petition the Secretary for a hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary is authorized to grant a variance from any standard or portion thereof whenever he determines, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies, that such variance is necessary to permit an employer to participate in an experiment approved by him or the Secretary of Health and Human Services designed to demonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of workers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any standard promulgated under this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or other appropriate forms of warning as are necessary to insure that employees are apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed, relevant symptoms and appropriate emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use or exposure. Where appropriate, such standard shall also prescribe suitable protective equipment and control or technological procedures to be used in connection with such hazards and shall provide for monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in such manner as may be necessary for the protection of employees. In addition, where appropriate, any such standard shall prescribe the type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available, by the employer or at his cost, to employees exposed to such hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of such employees is adversely affected by such exposure. In the event such medical examinations are in the nature of research, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, such examinations may be furnished at the expense of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The results of such examinations or tests shall be furnished only to the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and, at the request of the employee, to his physician. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may by rule promulgated pursuant to section 553 of title 5, make appropriate modifications in the foregoing requirements relating to the use of labels or other forms of warning, monitoring or measuring, and medical examinations, as may be warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments acquired subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) Whenever a rule promulgated by the Secretary differs substantially from an existing national consensus standard, the Secretary shall, at the same time, publish in the Federal Register a statement of the reasons why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national consensus standard.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Emergency temporary standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall provide, without regard to the requirements of chapter 5 of title 5, for an emergency temporary standard to take immediate effect upon publication in the Federal Register if he determines (A) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and (B) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard promulgated in accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon publication of such standard in the Federal Register the Secretary shall commence a proceeding in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the standard as published shall also serve as a proposed rule for the proceeding. The Secretary shall promulgate a standard under this paragraph no later than six months after publication of the emergency standard as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Variances from standards; procedure</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any affected employer may apply to the Secretary for a rule or order for a variance from a standard promulgated under this section. Affected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The Secretary shall issue such rule or order if he determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard. The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees, or by the Secretary on his own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subsection at any time after six months from its issuance.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Statement of reasons for Secretary's determinations; publication in Federal Register</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary promulgates any standard, makes any rule, order, or decision, grants any exemption or extension of time, or compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under this chapter, he shall include a statement of the reasons for such action, which shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Judicial review</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any person who may be adversely affected by a standard issued under this section may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated file a petition challenging the validity of such standard with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review of such standard. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The filing of such petition shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the standard. The determinations of the Secretary shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Priority for establishment of standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In determining the priority for establishing standards under this section, the Secretary shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for particular industries, trades, crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments. The Secretary shall also give due regard to the recommendations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the need for mandatory standards in determining the priority for establishing such standards.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;718 &#183; Traditionally underserved populations</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VII of this chapter, the Congress finds as follows:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Racial profile</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The racial profile of America is rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Latinos, 14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year 2000, the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-American.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of disability</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. The rate of work-related disability for American Indians is about one and one-half times that of the general population. African-Americans are also one and one-half times more likely to be disabled than whites and twice as likely to be significantly disabled.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inequitable treatment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recruitment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Outreach to minorities</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Benefit plans as affecting interstate commerce and the Federal taxing power</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and economic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are affected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate character of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans are carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their operation, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, and to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are afforded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby further declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 93&#8211;406, title I, &#167;2, Sept. 2, 1974, 88 Stat. 832.</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">the amendments made by section 301 shall not apply to plan amendments adopted before April 1, 1985, pursuant to such successor agreements (without regard to any modification or reopening after December 31, 1984).</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">the amendments made by sections 103 and 203 shall be treated as in effect as of the time of such participant's death. In the case of a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan to which this paragraph applies, the plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of the amendments made by sections 103 and 203 with respect to any participant if the plan made a distribution in a form other than a life annuity to the surviving spouse of the participant of such participant's nonforfeitable benefit.</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">then such participant may elect to have section 205 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [section 1055 of this title] and section 401(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [section 401(a)(11) of Title 26] (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act) apply.</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">then such participant may elect to have the qualified preretirement survivor annuity requirements of the amendments made by sections 103 and 203 apply.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1001a &#183; Additional Congressional findings and declaration of policy</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effects of multiemployer pension plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by multiemployer pension plans; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster and facilitate interstate commerce,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to alleviate certain problems which tend to discourage the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide reasonable protection for the interests of participants and beneficiaries of financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide a financially self-sufficient program for the guarantee of employee benefits under multiemployer plans.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1001b &#183; Findings and declaration of policy</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) single-employer defined benefit pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the continued well-being and retirement income security of millions of workers, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by such plans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the existence of a sound termination insurance system is fundamental to the retirement income security of participants and beneficiaries of such plans; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the current termination insurance system in some instances encourages employers to terminate pension plans, evade their obligations to pay benefits, and shift unfunded pension liabilities onto the termination insurance system and the other premium-payers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that modification of the current termination insurance system and an increase in the insurance premium for single-employer defined benefit pension plans&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is desirable to increase the likelihood that full benefits will be paid to participants and beneficiaries of such plans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is desirable to provide for the transfer of liabilities to the termination insurance system only in cases of severe hardship;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is necessary to maintain the premium costs of such system at a reasonable level; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is necessary to finance properly current funding deficiencies and future obligations of the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Declaration of policy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this title&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster and facilitate interstate commerce;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the maintenance and growth of single-employer defined benefit pension plans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to increase the likelihood that participants and beneficiaries under single-employer defined benefit pension plans will receive their full benefits;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide for the transfer of unfunded pension liabilities onto the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system only in cases of severe hardship;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to maintain the premium costs of such system at a reasonable level; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) In the case of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions which accrued before September 2, 1974, a right to such accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that an amount of such accrued benefit may be forfeited on account of the withdrawal by the participant of an amount attributable to the benefit derived from mandatory contributions, made by such participant before September 2, 1974, if such amount forfeited is proportional to such amount withdrawn.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) only in the year in which the absence from work begins, if a participant would be prevented from incurring a 1-year break in service in such year solely because the period of absence is treated as hours of service as provided in clause (i); or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Plan amendments altering vesting schedule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A plan amendment changing any vesting schedule under the plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of this section if the nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (determined as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted, or the date such amendment becomes effective) of any employee who is a participant in the plan is less than such nonforfeitable percentage computed under the plan without regard to such amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan amendment changing any vesting schedule under the plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of this section unless each participant having not less than 3 years of service is permitted to elect, within a reasonable period after adoption of such amendment, to have his nonforfeitable percentage computed under the plan without regard to such amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to benefits which may not be provided for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A pension plan may allow for nonforfeitable benefits after a lesser period and in greater amounts than are required by this part.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consent for distribution; present value; covered distributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the present value shall be calculated in accordance with section 1055(g)(3) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall not apply to any distribution of dividends to which section 404(k) of title 26 applies.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1054 &#183; Benefit accrual requirements</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section, and&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enumeration of plan requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the number of years (not in excess of 331/3) of his participation in the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 1331/3 percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &#8220;year of service&#8221; has the meaning provided by section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 1081(b) of this title (relating to certain insurance contract plans),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">but only if an employee's accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 1081(b) of this title were satisfied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant's accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which benefits under the plan&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) do not exceed social security benefits, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) terminate when such social security benefits commence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 1056(a)(3) of this title, and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to section 1053(a)(3)(B) of this title, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of section 414(q) of title 26) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees within the meaning of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(v) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of section 411(b)(1)(H) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this subparagraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(1)(H).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 411(b)(2) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &#8220;year of participation&#8221; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 1052(b) of this title, determined without regard to section 1052(b)(5) of this title) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &#8220;year of participation&#8221; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) For purposes of this subsection in the case of any maritime industry, 125 days of service shall be treated as a year of participation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section and section 1053 of this title an employee's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions as of any applicable date is the excess (if any) of the accrued benefit for such employee as of such applicable date over the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by such employee as of such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a plan other than a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) except as provided in clause (ii), the balance of the employee's separate account consisting only of his contributions and the income, expenses, gains, and losses attributable thereto, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Defined benefit plans.&#8212;In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;accumulated contributions&#8221; means the total of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all mandatory contributions made by the employee,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) interest (if any) under the plan to the end of the last plan year to which section 1053(a)(2) of this title does not apply (by reason of the applicable effective date), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) interest on the sum of the amounts determined under clauses (i) and (ii) compounded annually&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of a plan year for the period beginning with the 1st plan year to which subsection (a)(2) of this section applies by reason of the applicable effective date) and ending with the date on which the determination is being made, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date) for the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on which the employee attains normal retirement age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &#8220;mandatory contributions&#8221; means amounts contributed to the plan by the employee which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plans, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee's accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee's accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Employee service which may be disregarded in determining employee's accrued benefits under plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1053(b)(1) of this title, for purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit under the plan, the plan may disregard service performed by the employee with respect to which he has received&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under section 1053(e)(1) of this title) permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a distribution of the present value of his nonforfeitable benefit attributable to such service which he elected to receive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraph (1) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee's participation in the plan. Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee's participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit, the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) of this section unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) of this section with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section and provides that upon such repayment the employee's accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) resumes employment covered under the plan, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) repays the full amount of such distribution with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The plan provision required under this subsection may provide that such repayment must be made (A) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (B) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5 years after the date of the withdrawal.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Employer treated as maintaining a plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this part, an employer shall be treated as maintaining a plan if any employee of such employer accrues benefits under such plan by reason of service with such employer.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Decrease of accrued benefits through amendment of plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) or 1441 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan amendment which has the effect of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in regulations), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) eliminating an optional form of benefit,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide that this paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment which reduces or eliminates benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants, unless such amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in subparagraph (B) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in subparagraph (A)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, any&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 409(a) of title 26, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7) of title 26),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because it modifies distribution options in a nondiscriminatory manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the &#8220;transferee plan&#8221;) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because the transferee plan does not provide some or all of the forms of distribution previously available under another defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the &#8220;transferor plan&#8221;) to the extent that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the forms of distribution previously available under the transferor plan applied to the account of a participant or beneficiary under the transferor plan that was transferred from the transferor plan to the transferee plan pursuant to a direct transfer rather than pursuant to a distribution from the transferor plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the terms of both the transferor plan and the transferee plan authorize the transfer described in clause (i);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the transfer described in clause (i) was made pursuant to a voluntary election by the participant or beneficiary whose account was transferred to the transferee plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the election described in clause (iii) was made after the participant or beneficiary received a notice describing the consequences of making the election; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the transferee plan allows the participant or beneficiary described in clause (iii) to receive any distribution to which the participant or beneficiary is entitled under the transferee plan in the form of a single sum distribution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply to plan mergers and other transactions having the effect of a direct transfer, including consolidations of benefits attributable to different employers within a multiple employer plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Except to the extent provided in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, a defined contribution plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because of the elimination of a form of distribution previously available thereunder. This paragraph shall not apply to the elimination of a form of distribution with respect to any participant unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a single sum payment is available to such participant at the same time or times as the form of distribution being eliminated; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such single sum payment is based on the same or greater portion of the participant's account as the form of distribution being eliminated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Notice of significant reduction in benefit accruals</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) An applicable pension plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each applicable individual (and to each employee organization representing applicable individuals).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The notice required by paragraph (1) shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and shall provide sufficient information (as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) to allow applicable individuals to understand the effect of the plan amendment. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide a simplified form of notice for, or exempt from any notice requirement, a plan&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which has fewer than 100 participants who have accrued a benefit under the plan, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which offers participants the option to choose between the new benefit formula and the old benefit formula.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the notice required by paragraph (1) shall be provided within a reasonable time before the effective date of the plan amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any notice under paragraph (1) may be provided to a person designated, in writing, by the person to which it would otherwise be provided.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) merely because notice is provided before the adoption of the plan amendment if no material modification of the amendment occurs before the amendment is adopted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In the case of any egregious failure to meet any requirement of this subsection with respect to any plan amendment, the provisions of the applicable pension plan shall be applied as if such plan amendment entitled all applicable individuals to the greater of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the benefits to which they would have been entitled without regard to such amendment, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the benefits under the plan with regard to such amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), there is an egregious failure to meet the requirements of this subsection if such failure is within the control of the plan sponsor and is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an intentional failure (including any failure to promptly provide the required notice or information after the plan administrator discovers an unintentional failure to meet the requirements of this subsection),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a failure to provide most of the individuals with most of the information they are entitled to receive under this subsection, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a failure which is determined to be egregious under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations allow any notice under this subsection to be provided by using new technologies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) For purposes of this subsection&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &#8220;applicable individual&#8221; means, with respect to any plan amendment&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) each participant in the plan; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any beneficiary who is an alternate payee (within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title) under an applicable qualified domestic relations order (within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">whose rate of future benefit accrual under the plan may reasonably be expected to be significantly reduced by such plan amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &#8220;applicable pension plan&#8221; means&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any defined benefit plan; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an individual account plan which is subject to the funding standards of section 412 of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(9) For purposes of this subsection, a plan amendment which eliminates or reduces any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy (within the meaning of subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section) shall be treated as having the effect of reducing the rate of future benefit accrual.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Prohibition on benefit increases where plan sponsor is in bankruptcy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a plan described in paragraph (3) which is maintained by an employer that is a debtor in a case under title 11 or similar Federal or State law, no amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any increase in benefits,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any change in the accrual of benefits, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to employees of the debtor, shall be effective prior to the effective date of such employer's plan of reorganization.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any plan amendment that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be reasonable and that provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan with respect to employees of the debtor,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) only repeals an amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) of this title,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) was adopted prior to, or pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement entered into prior to, the date on which the employer became a debtor in a case under title 11 or similar Federal or State law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall apply only to plans (other than multiemployer plans) covered under section 1321 of this title for which the funded current liability percentage (within the meaning of section 1082(d)(8) of this title) is less than 100 percent after taking into account the effect of the amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;employer&#8221; has the meaning set forth in section 1082(c)(11)(A) of this title, without regard to section 1082(c)(11)(B) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Plans meeting requirements of section</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A plan meets the requirements of this section only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under the plan, each participant&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) may elect at any time during the applicable election period to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit (or both), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe) a written explanation of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the participant's right to make, and the effect of, an election under paragraph (1) to waive the joint and survivor annuity form of benefit,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the rights of the participant's spouse under paragraph (2), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within the applicable period with respect to such participant (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation with respect to the qualified preretirement survivor annuity comparable to that required under subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term &#8220;applicable period&#8221; means, with respect to a participant, whichever of the following periods ends last:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The period beginning with the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the participant attains age 35.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) A reasonable period ending after this section applies to the participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who separates from service before attaining age 35, the applicable period shall be a reasonable period after separation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each plan shall provide that, if this section applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply with respect to the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit, as the case may be, if such benefit may not be waived (or another beneficiary selected) and if the plan fully subsidizes the costs of such benefit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relying on a consent or revocation referred to in paragraph (1)(A), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) making a determination under paragraph (2),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the participant terminates his service with the employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forfeiture of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title.</p>

For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant's accrued non-forfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 of title 26 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1) of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.

<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if married for at least 1 year, the surviving former spouse shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1055(f) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,</p>

Such rates shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of 2 or more indices that are selected periodically by the Secretary of the Treasury and that are in the top 3 quality levels available. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the permissible range, and the indices and methodology used to determine the average rate, publicly available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Secretarial authority.&#8212;If the Secretary finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) or (II) is unreasonably high, the Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under such subclause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) or (3)(B)(ii) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 20 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 3 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from a plan amendment adopted before such date, shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the plan's enrolled actuary certifies (in such form and manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) that the amendment provides for an increase in annual contributions which will exceed the increase in annual charges to the funding standard account attributable to such amendment, or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Methods</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this part, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of this part, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this part, the value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, this subparagraph shall not apply, but the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of such plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under subsection (b)(5) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In general.&#8212;If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) In general.&#8212;No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (d)(7)(C) of this section) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Plans to which subparagraph applies.&#8212;This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if&#8212;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1083 &#183; Variance from minimum funding standard</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Waiver of requirements in event of business hardship</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If an employer, or in the case of a multi-employer plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) and if application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate, the Secretary of the Treasury may waive the requirements of section 1082(a) of this title for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard other than the portion thereof determined under section 1082(b)(2)(C) of this title. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years. The interest rate used for purposes of computing the amortization charge described in subsection (b)(2)(C) of this section for any plan year shall be&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, the greater of (A) 150 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of such plan year), or (B) the rate of interest used under the plan in determining costs (including adjustments under section 1082(b)(5)(B) of this title), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the rate determined under section 6621(b) of title 26.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Matters considered in determining business hardship</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the factors taken into account in determining temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) shall include (but shall not be limited to) whether&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the employer is operating at an economic loss,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &#8220;Waived funding deficiency&#8221; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &#8220;waived funding deficiency&#8221; means the portion of the minimum funding standard (determined without regard to subsection (b)(3)(C) of section 1082 of this title) for a plan year waived by the Secretary of the Treasury and not satisfied by employer contributions.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, if an employer is a member of a controlled group, the temporary substantial business hardship requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as met only if such requirements are met&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with respect to such employer, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to the controlled group of which such employer is a member (determined by treating all members of such group as a single employer).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if the Secretary of the Treasury determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Controlled group</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &#8220;controlled group&#8221; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of title 26.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice of filing of application for waiver</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting a waiver under this section, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such waiver to each employee organization representing employees covered by the affected plan, and each affected party (as defined in section 1301(a)(21) of this title) other than the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

In the case of a multiemployer plan, such rate shall be the rate determined under section 6621(b) of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) No amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under section 1083(a) of this title or an extension of time under subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) of this title has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that the insurer manage those assets of the insurer which are assets of such insurer's general account (irrespective of whether any such assets are plan assets) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, taking into account all obligations supported by such enterprise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Compliance by the insurer with all requirements of the regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deemed compliance by such insurer with sections 1104, 1106, and 1107 of this title with respect to those assets of the insurer's general account which support a policy described in paragraph (3).</p>

Action under this subsection may be taken only after consultation and coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury. An exemption granted under this section shall not relieve a fiduciary from any other applicable provision of this chapter. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection unless he finds that such exemption is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Before granting an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(a) or 1107(a) of this title, the Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the exemption, shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and shall afford interested persons opportunity to present views. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(b) of this title unless he affords an opportunity for a hearing and makes a determination on the record with respect to the findings required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The investment of all or part of a plan's assets in deposits which bear a reasonable interest rate in a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan and if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan covers only employees of such bank or other institution and employees of affiliates of such bank or other institution, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such investment is expressly authorized by a provision of the plan or by a fiduciary (other than such bank or institution or affiliate thereof) who is expressly empowered by the plan to so instruct the trustee with respect to such investment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such bank or similar financial institution has adopted adequate internal safeguards which assure that the providing of such ancillary service is consistent with sound banking and financial practice, as determined by Federal or State supervisory authority, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Secretary after consultation with Federal and State supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (e) of this section are met with respect to such stock,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the later of the date on which the stock was acquired by the plan, or January 1, 1975, such stock constituted a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as then in effect), and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1306 &#183; Premium rates</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Schedules for premium rates and bases for application; establishment, coverage, etc.</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation shall prescribe such schedules of premium rates and bases for the application of those rates as may be necessary to provide sufficient revenue to the fund for the corporation to carry out its functions under this subchapter. The premium rates charged by the corporation for any period shall be uniform for all plans, other than multiemployer plans, insured by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title, and shall be uniform for all multiemployer plans with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation shall maintain separate schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title for single-employer plans,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title for multiemployer plans,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) nonbasic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title for single-employer plans,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) nonbasic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title for multiemployer plans, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) reimbursements of uncollectible withdrawal liability under section 1402 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation may revise such schedules whenever it determines that revised schedules are necessary. Except as provided in section 1322a(f) of this title, in order to place a revised schedule described in subparagraph (A) or (B) in effect, the corporation shall proceed in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section, and such schedule shall apply only to plan years beginning more than 30 days after the date on which a joint resolution approving such revised schedule is enacted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the annual premium rate payable to the corporation by all plans for basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of a single-employer plan, for plan years beginning after December 31, 1990, an amount equal to the sum of $19 plus the additional premium (if any) determined under subparagraph (E) for each individual who is a participant in such plan during the plan year;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, for the plan year within which the date of enactment of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 falls, an amount for each individual who is a participant in such plan for such plan year equal to the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 50 cents, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months in such year ending on or before such date and the denominator of which is 12, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) $1.00, multiplied by a fraction equal to 1 minus the fraction determined under clause (i),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, for plan years beginning after September 26, 1980, an amount equal to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) $1.40 for each participant, for the first, second, third, and fourth plan years,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) $1.80 for each participant, for the fifth and sixth plan years,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) $2.20 for each participant, for the seventh and eighth plan years, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) $2.60 for each participant, for the ninth plan year, and for each succeeding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation the extent to which the rate described in subparagraph (A)(i) applies more than once for any plan year to an individual participating in more than one plan maintained by the same employer, and the corporation may prescribe regulations under which the rate described in subparagraph (A)(iii) will not apply to the same participant in any multiemployer plan more than once for any plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amounts in any fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the value of any assets held by the corporation for payment of basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">is for any calendar year less than 2 times the amount of basic benefits guaranteed by the corporation under this subchapter for multiemployer plans which were paid out of any such fund or assets during the preceding calendar year, the annual premium rates under subparagraph (A) shall be increased to the next highest premium level necessary to insure that such sum will be at least 2 times greater than such amount during the following calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the board of directors of the corporation determines that an increase in the premium rates under subparagraph (A) is necessary to provide assistance to plans which are receiving assistance under section 1431 of this title and to plans the board finds are reasonably likely to require such assistance, the board may order such increase in the premium rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The maximum annual premium rate which may be established under this subparagraph is $2.60 for each participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply if the annual premium rate is increased to a level in excess of $2.60 per participant under any other provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Not later than 120 days before the date on which an increase under subparagraph (C)(ii) is to become effective, the corporation shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the determination described in subparagraph (C)(ii), the basis for the determination, the amount of the increase in the premium, and the anticipated increase in premium income that would result from the increase in the premium rate. The notice shall invite public comment, and shall provide for a public hearing if one is requested. Any such hearing shall be commenced not later than 60 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The board of directors shall review the hearing record established under clause (i) and shall, not later than 30 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective, determine (after consideration of the comments received) whether the amount of the increase should be changed and shall publish its determination in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The additional premium determined under this subparagraph with respect to any plan for any plan year shall be an amount equal to the amount determined under clause (ii) divided by the number of participants in such plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amount determined under this clause for any plan year shall be an amount equal to $9.00 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of unfunded vested benefits under the plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For purposes of clause (ii)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) Except as provided in subclause (II) or (III), the term &#8220;unfunded vested benefits&#8221; means the amount which would be the unfunded current liability (within the meaning of section 1082(d)(8)(A) of this title) if only vested benefits were taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) The interest rate used in valuing vested benefits for purposes of subclause (I) shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the annual yield on 30-year Treasury securities for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins. For purposes of this subclause, the applicable percentage is 80 percent for plan years beginning before July 1, 1997, 85 percent for plan years beginning after June 30, 1997, and before the 1st plan year to which the first tables prescribed under section 1082(d)(7)(C)(ii)(II) of this title apply, and 100 percent for such 1st plan year and subsequent plan years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) In the case of any plan year for which the applicable percentage under subclause (II) is 100 percent, the value of the plan's assets used in determining unfunded current liability under subclause (I) shall be their fair market value.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) In the case of plan years beginning after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, subclause (II) shall be applied by substituting &#8220;100 percent&#8221; for &#8220;85 percent&#8221;. Subclause (III) shall be applied for such years without regard to the preceding sentence. Any reference to this clause or this subparagraph by any other sections or subsections (other than sections 1305, 1310, 1311, and 1343 of this title) shall be treated as a reference to this clause or this subparagraph without regard to this subclause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) In the case of plan years beginning after December 31, 2003, and before January 1, 2006, the annual yield taken into account under subclause (II) shall be the annual rate of interest determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on amounts invested conservatively in long-term investment grade corporate bonds for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine such rate of interest on the basis of 2 or more indices that are selected periodically by the Secretary of the Treasury and that are in the top 3 quality levels available. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the permissible range, and the indices and methodology used to determine the rate, publicly available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) No premium shall be determined under this subparagraph for any plan year if, as of the close of the preceding plan year, contributions to the plan for the preceding plan year were not less than the full funding limitation for the preceding plan year under section 412(c)(7) of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may prescribe, subject to the enactment of a joint resolution in accordance with this section or section 1322a(f) of this title, alternative schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for basic benefits guaranteed by it under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title based, in whole or in part, on the risks insured by the corporation in each plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In carrying out its authority under paragraph (1) to establish schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for nonbasic benefits guaranteed under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title the premium rates charged by the corporation for any period for nonbasic benefits guaranteed shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) be uniform by category of nonbasic benefits guaranteed,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) be based on the risks insured in each category, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) reflect the experience of the corporation (including experience which may be reasonably anticipated) in guaranteeing such benefits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), premium rates charged to any multiemployer plan by the corporation for any period for supplemental guarantees under section 1322a(g)(2) of this title may reflect any reasonable considerations which the corporation determines to be appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In carrying out its authority under paragraph (1) to establish premium rates and bases for basic benefits guaranteed under section 1322 of this title with respect to single-employer plans, the corporation shall establish such rates and bases in coverage schedules in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans composed of the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a charge based on a rate applicable to the excess, if any, of the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed over the value of the assets of the plan, not in excess of 0.1 percent, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an additional charge based on a rate applicable to the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The rate for the additional charge referred to in clause (ii) shall be set by the corporation for every year at a level which the corporation estimates will yield total revenue approximately equal to the total revenue to be derived by the corporation from the charges referred to in clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans based on&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of participants in a plan, but such premium rates shall not exceed the rates described in paragraph (3),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) unfunded basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter, but such premium rates shall not exceed the limitations applicable to charges referred to in subparagraph (B)(i), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) total guaranteed basic benefits, but such premium rates shall not exceed the rates for additional charges referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If the corporation uses two or more of the rate bases described in this subparagraph, the premium rates shall be designed to produce approximately equal amounts of aggregate premium revenue from each of the rate bases used.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the corporation shall by regulation define the terms &#8220;value of assets&#8221; and &#8220;present value of the benefits of the plan which are guaranteed&#8221; in a manner consistent with the purposes of this subchapter and the provisions of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Revised schedule; Congressional procedures applicable</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to place a revised schedule (other than a schedule described in subsection (a)(2)(C), (D), or (E) of this section) in effect, the corporation shall transmit the proposed schedule, its proposed effective date, and the reasons for its proposal to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives, and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The succeeding paragraphs of this subsection are enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions described in paragraph (3). They shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, &#8220;resolution&#8221; means only a joint resolution, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &#8220;The proposed revised schedule transmitted to Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on ____ is hereby approved.&#8221;, the blank space therein being filled with the date on which the corporation's message proposing the rate was delivered.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A resolution shall be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) If a committee to which has been referred a resolution has not reported it before the expiration of 10 calendar days after its introduction, it shall then (but not before) be in order to move to discharge the committee from further consideration of that resolution, or to discharge the committee from further consideration of any other resolution with respect to the proposed adjustment which has been referred to the committee. The motion to discharge may be made only by a person favoring the resolution, shall be highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution with respect to the same proposed rate), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other resolution with respect to the same proposed rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) When a committee has reported, or has been discharged from further consideration of a resolution, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. Debate on the resolution shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee, or the consideration of, a resolution and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business shall be decided without debate. Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution shall be decided without debate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Premiums payable when due; accrual; waiver or reduction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The designated payor of each plan shall pay the premiums imposed by the corporation under this subchapter with respect to that plan when they are due. Premiums under this subchapter are payable at the time, and on an estimated, advance, or other basis, as determined by the corporation. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on September 2, 1974 (applicable to that portion of any plan year during which such date occurs) are due within 30 days after such date. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on the first plan year commencing after September 2, 1974, are due within 30 days after such plan year commences. Premiums shall continue to accrue until a plan's assets are distributed pursuant to a termination procedure, or until a trustee is appointed pursuant to section 1342 of this title, whichever is earlier. The corporation may waive or reduce premiums for a multiemployer plan for any plan year during which such plan receives financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title, except that any amount so waived or reduced shall be treated as financial assistance under such section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Late payment charge; waiver</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If any basic benefit premium is not paid when it is due the corporation is authorized to assess a late payment charge of not more than 100 percent of the premium payment which was not timely paid. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any payment of premium made within 60 days after the date on which payment is due, if before such date, the designated payor obtains a waiver from the corporation based upon a showing of substantial hardship arising from the timely payment of the premium. The corporation is authorized to grant a waiver under this subsection upon application made by the designated payor, but the corporation may not grant a waiver if it appears that the designated payor will be unable to pay the premium within 60 days after the date on which it is due. If any premium is not paid by the last date prescribed for a payment, interest on the amount of such premium at the rate imposed under section 6601(a) of title 26 (relating to interest on underpayment, nonpayment, or extensions of time for payment of tax) shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Civil action to recover premium penalty and interest</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If any designated payor fails to pay a premium when due, the corporation is authorized to bring a civil action in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the plan assets are located, the plan is administered, or in which a defendant resides or is found for the recovery of the amount of the premium penalty, and interest, and process may be served in any other district. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over actions brought under this subsection by the corporation without regard to the amount in controversy.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basic benefits guarantee not stopped by designated payor's failure to pay premiums when due</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The corporation shall not cease to guarantee basic benefits on account of the failure of a designated payor to pay any premium when due.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Designated payor</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan administrator in the case of a multiemployer plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the contributing sponsor of any single-employer plan is a member of a controlled group, each member of such group shall be jointly and severally liable for any premiums required to be paid by such contributing sponsor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &#8220;controlled group&#8221; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of title 26.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1322 &#183; Single-employer plan benefits guaranteed</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonforfeitable benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations contained in subsection (b) of this section, the corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a single-employer plan which terminates at a time when this subchapter applies to it.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (7)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) no benefits provided by a plan which has been in effect for less than 60 months at the time the plan terminates shall be guaranteed under this section, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any increase in the amount of benefits under a plan resulting from a plan amendment which was made, or became effective, whichever is later, within 60 months before the date on which the plan terminates shall be disregarded.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the time a successor plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) has been in effect includes the time a previously established plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) was in effect. For purposes of determining what benefits are guaranteed under this section in the case of a plan to which section 1321 of this title does not apply on September 3, 1974, the 60-month period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed beginning on the first date on which such section does apply to the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of monthly benefits described in subsection (a) of this section provided by a plan, which are guaranteed under this section with respect to a participant, shall not have an actuarial value which exceeds the actuarial value of a monthly benefit in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 65 equal to the lesser of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) his average monthly gross income from his employer during the 5 consecutive calendar year period (or, if less, during the number of calendar years in such period in which he actively participates in the plan) during which his gross income from that employer was greater than during any other such period with that employer determined by dividing 1/12 of the sum of all such gross income by the number of such calendar years in which he had such gross income, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $750 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 430]) in effect at the time the plan terminates and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base in effect in calendar year 1974.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to non-basic benefits. The maximum guaranteed monthly benefit shall not be reduced solely on account of the age of a participant in the case of a benefit payable by reason of disability that occurred on or before the termination date, if the participant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that the Social Security Administration has determined that the participant satisfies the definition of disability under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.; 1381 et seq.], and the regulations thereunder. If a benefit payable by reason of disability is converted to an early or normal retirement benefit for reasons other than a change in the health of the participant, such early or normal retirement benefit shall be treated as a continuation of the benefit payable by reason of disability and this subparagraph shall continue to apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The actuarial value of a benefit, for purposes of this subsection, shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of paragraph (3)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &#8220;gross income&#8221; means &#8220;earned income&#8221; within the meaning of section 911(b) of title 26 (determined without regard to any community property laws),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a participant in a plan under which contributions are made by more than one employer, amounts received as gross income from any employer under that plan shall be aggregated with amounts received from any other employer under that plan during the same period, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any non-basic benefit shall be disregarded.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &#8220;substantial owner&#8221; means an individual who&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a partnership, is a partner who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in such partnership, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of clause (iii) the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) of title 26 shall apply (determined without regard to section 1563(e)(3)(C)). For purposes of this subchapter an individual is also treated as a substantial owner with respect to a plan if, at any time within the 60 months preceding the date on which the determination is made, he was a substantial owner under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a participant in a plan under which benefits have not been increased by reason of any plan amendments and who is covered by the plan as a substantial owner, the amount of benefits guaranteed under this section shall not exceed the product of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a fraction (not to exceed 1) the numerator of which is the number of years the substantial owner was an active participant in the plan, and the denominator of which is 30, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of the substantial owner's monthly benefits guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section (as limited under paragraph (3) of this subsection).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a participant in a plan, other than a plan described in subparagraph (B), who is covered by the plan as a substantial owner, the amount of the benefit guaranteed under this section shall, under regulations prescribed by the corporation, treat each benefit increase attributable to a plan amendment as if it were provided under a new plan. The benefits guaranteed under this section with respect to all such amendments shall not exceed the amount which would be determined under subparagraph (B) if subparagraph (B) applied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury issues notice that he has determined that any trust which is a part of a plan does not meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26, or that the plan does not meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph does not apply if the Secretary subsequently issues a notice that such trust meets the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26 and if the Secretary determines that the trust or plan has taken action necessary to meet such requirements during the period between the issuance of the notice referred to in the preceding sentence and the issuance of the notice referred to in this sentence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which an amendment of the plan is adopted which causes the Secretary of the Treasury to determine that any trust under the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph shall not apply if the amendment is revoked as of the date it was first effective or amended to comply with such requirements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Benefits described in paragraph (1) are guaranteed only to the extent of the greater of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 20 percent of the amount which, but for the fact that the plan or amendment has not been in effect for 60 months or more, would be guaranteed under this section, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $20 per month,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">multiplied by the number of years (but not more than 5) the plan or amendment, as the case may be, has been in effect. In determining how many years a plan or amendment has been in effect for purposes of this paragraph, the first 12 months beginning with the date on which the plan or amendment is made or first becomes effective (whichever is later) constitutes one year, and each consecutive period of 12 months thereafter constitutes an additional year. This paragraph does not apply to benefits payable under a plan unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment by corporation to participants and beneficiaries of recovery percentage of outstanding amount of benefit liabilities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to benefits paid under the preceding provisions of this section with respect to a terminated plan, the corporation shall pay the portion of the amount determined under paragraph (2) which is allocated with respect to each participant under section 1344(a) of this title. Such payment shall be made to such participant or to such participant's beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount determined under this paragraph is an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the outstanding amount of benefit liabilities under the plan (including interest calculated from the termination date), by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the applicable recovery ratio.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), for purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;recovery ratio&#8221; means the average ratio, with respect to prior plan terminations described in subparagraph (B), of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the value of the recovery of the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title in connection with such prior terminations, to</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under such plans as of the termination date in connection with such prior terminations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan termination described in this subparagraph is a termination with respect to which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the corporation has determined the value of recoveries under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notices of intent to terminate were provided after December 17, 1987, and during the 5-Federal fiscal year period ending with the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which occurs the date of the notice of intent to terminate with respect to the plan termination for which the recovery ratio is being determined.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a terminated plan with respect to which the outstanding amount of benefit liabilities exceeds $20,000,000, for purposes of this section, the term &#8220;recovery ratio&#8221; means, with respect to the termination of such plan, the ratio of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the value of the recoveries of the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title in connection with such plan, to</p>

Any extension may be made upon such terms and conditions (including the payment of benefits) as are agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Final distribution of assets in absence of notice of noncompliance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The plan administrator shall commence the final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan as soon as practicable after the expiration of the 60-day (or extended) period referred to in subparagraph (C), but such final distribution may occur only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the plan administrator has not received during such period a notice of noncompliance from the corporation under subparagraph (C), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) when such final distribution occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Methods of final distribution of assets</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification to the corporation of final distribution of assets</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 30 days after the final distribution of assets is completed pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation certifying that the assets of the plan have been distributed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) so as to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Continuing authority</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reorganization in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirements of this clause are met by a person if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such person has filed, or has had filed against such person, as of the proposed termination date, a petition seeking reorganization in a case under title 11 or under any similar law of a State or political subdivision of a State (or a case described in clause (i) filed by or against such person has been converted, as of such date, to such a case in which reorganization is sought),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs of providing pension coverage have become unreasonably burdensome to such person, solely as a result of a decline of such person's workforce covered as participants under all single-employer plans of which such person is a contributing sponsor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The corporation shall notify the plan administrator as soon as practicable of its determinations made pursuant to subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">After the corporation notifies the plan administrator of its determinations under subparagraph (A), the termination of the plan shall be carried out as soon as practicable, as provided in clause (i), (ii), or (iii).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Cases of sufficiency for benefit liabilities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets, and make certification to the corporation with respect to such distribution, in the manner described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, and shall take such other actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Cases of sufficiency for guaranteed benefits without a finding of sufficiency for benefit liabilities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits, but further determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities on the basis of the information made available to it, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets in the manner described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, make certification to the corporation that the distribution has occurred, and take such actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Cases without any finding of sufficiency</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits on the basis of the information made available to it, the corporation shall commence proceedings in accordance with section 1342 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Finding with respect to benefit liabilities which are not guaranteed benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized under subparagraph (B)(i), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay benefit liabilities which are not benefits guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Finding with respect to guaranteed benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized by subparagraph (B)(i) or (ii), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay all benefits under the plan which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter. If the corporation concurs in the finding of the plan administrator (or the corporation itself makes such a finding), the corporation shall institute appropriate proceedings under section 1342 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Administration of the plan during interim period</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The plan administrator shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) meet the requirements of clause (ii) for the period commencing on the date on which the plan administrator provides a notice of distress termination to the corporation under subsection (a)(2) of this section and ending on the date on which the plan administrator receives notification from the corporation of its determinations under subparagraph (A), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) meet the requirements of clause (ii) commencing on the date on which the plan administrator or the corporation makes a finding under subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirements of this clause are met by the plan administrator if the plan administrator&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) refrains from distributing assets or taking any other actions to carry out the proposed termination under this subsection,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) pays benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) does not use plan assets to purchase irrevocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) continues to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan, but, commencing on the proposed termination date, limits the payment of benefits under the plan to those benefits which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title or to which assets are required to be allocated under section 1344 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;In the event the plan administrator is later determined not to have met the requirements for distress termination, any benefits which are not paid solely by reason of compliance with subclause (IV) shall be due and payable immediately (together with interest, at a reasonable rate, in accordance with regulations of the corporation).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Sufficiency</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The adoption of an amendment to a plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title constitutes a termination of the plan. Such an amendment may take effect only after the plan satisfies the requirements for standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or distress termination under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Termination of a multiemployer plan under this section occurs as a result of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the adoption after September 26, 1980, of a plan amendment which provides that participants will receive no credit for any purpose under the plan for service with any employer after the date specified by such amendment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, within the meaning of section 1383 of this title, or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adoption of an amendment to the plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Date of termination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section is the later of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the amendment is adopted, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the amendment takes effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section is the earlier of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the last employer withdraws, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day of the first plan year for which no employer contributions were required under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duties of plan sponsor of amended plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) limit the payment of benefits to benefits which are nonforfeitable under the plan as of the date of the termination, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity, unless the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Duties of plan sponsor of nonoperative plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall reduce benefits and suspend benefit payments in accordance with section 1441 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of contribution of employer under amended plan for each plan year subsequent to plan termination date</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the rate of an employer's contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduction in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of benefits; reporting requirements for terminated plans and rules and standards for administration of such plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a terminated plan may authorize the payment other than in the form of an annuity of a participant's entire nonforfeitable benefit attributable to employer contributions, other than a death benefit, if the value of the entire nonforfeitable benefit does not exceed $1,750. The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation's risk of loss with respect to the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 93&#8211;406, title IV, &#167;4041A, as added Pub. L. 96&#8211;364, title I, &#167;103, Sept. 26, 1980, 94 Stat. 1216.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1342 &#183; Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under section 412 of title 26, or has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that a notice of deficiency under section 6212 of title 26 has been mailed with respect to the tax imposed under section 4971(a) of title 26,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the reportable event described in section 1343(c)(7) of this title has occurred, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c) of this section). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of trustee</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) of this section to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) of this section ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which section 1341a(d) of this title applies, unless such appointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjudication that plan must be terminated</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) of this section and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)&#160;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Powers of trustee</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section shall have the power&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to do any act authorized by the plan or this subchapter to be done by the plan administrator or any trustee of the plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to require the transfer of all (or any part) of the assets and records of the plan to himself as trustee;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to invest any assets of the plan which he holds in accordance with the provisions of the plan, regulations of the corporation, and applicable rules of law;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) to limit payment of benefits under the plan to basic benefits or to continue payment of some or all of the benefits which were being paid prior to his appointment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) in the case of a multiemployer plan, to reduce benefits or suspend benefit payments under the plan, give appropriate notices, amend the plan, and perform other acts required or authorized by subtitle (E) of this subchapter to be performed by the plan sponsor or administrator;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1344 &#183; Allocation of assets</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Order of priority of participants and beneficiaries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the termination of a single-employer plan, the plan administrator shall allocate the assets of the plan (available to provide benefits) among the participants and beneficiaries of the plan in the following order:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) First, to that portion of each individual's accrued benefit which is derived from the participant's contributions to the plan which were not mandatory contributions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Second, to that portion of each individual's accrued benefit which is derived from the participant's mandatory contributions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of the benefit of a participant or beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date of the plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a participant's or beneficiary's benefit (other than a benefit described in subparagraph (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such 3-year period if the participant had retired prior to the beginning of the 3-year period and if his benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a 3-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Fourth&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to all other benefits (if any) of individuals under the plan guaranteed under this subchapter (determined without regard to section 1322b(a) of this title), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the additional benefits (if any) which would be determined under subparagraph (A) if section 1322(b)(5) of this title did not apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, section 1321 of this title shall be applied without regard to subsection (c) thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Fifth, to all other nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Sixth, to all other benefits under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment of allocations; reallocations; mandatory contributions; establishment of subclasses and categories</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The amount allocated under any paragraph of subsection (a) of this section with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraphs (5) and (6)) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of title 26 then, if required to prevent the disqualification of the plan (or any trust under the plan) under section 401(a) or 403(a) of title 26, the assets allocated under subsections (a)(4)(B), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such discrimination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &#8220;mandatory contributions&#8221; means amounts contributed to the plan by a participant which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions. For this purpose, the total amount of mandatory contributions of a participant is the amount of such contributions reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts paid or distributed to him under the plan before its termination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A plan may establish subclasses and categories within the classes described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increase or decrease in value of assets</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring during the period beginning on the later of (1) the date a trustee is appointed under section 1342(b) of this title or (2) the date on which the plan is terminated is to be allocated between the plan and the corporation in the manner determined by the court (in the case of a court-appointed trustee) or as agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator in any other case. Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring after the date on which the plan is terminated shall be credited to, or suffered by, the corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Distribution of residual assets; restrictions on reversions pursuant to recently amended plans; assets attributable to employee contributions; calculation of remaining assets</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (3), any residual assets of a single-employer plan may be distributed to the employer if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all liabilities of the plan to participants and their beneficiaries have been satisfied,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in section 1058 of this title occurs, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of any assets transferred in such transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;employer&#8221; includes any member of the controlled group of which the employer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &#8220;controlled group&#8221; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m) or (o) of section 414 of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before any distribution from a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), if any assets of the plan attributable to employee contributions remain after satisfaction of all liabilities described in subsection (a) of this section, such remaining assets shall be equitably distributed to the participants who made such contributions or their beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the portion of the remaining assets which are attributable to employee contributions shall be an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the market value of the total remaining assets, by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the present value of all portions of the accrued benefits with respect to participants which are derived from participants&#8217; mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the present value of all benefits with respect to which assets are allocated under paragraphs (2) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, each person who is, as of the termination date&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a participant under the plan, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an individual who has received, during the 3-year period ending with the termination date, a distribution from the plan of such individual's entire nonforfeitable benefit in the form of a single sum distribution in accordance with section 1053(e) of this title or in the form of irrevocable commitments purchased by the plan from an insurer to provide such nonforfeitable benefit,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be treated as a participant with respect to the termination, if all or part of the nonforfeitable benefit with respect to such person is or was attributable to participants&#8217; mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the requirements of section 4980(d) of title 26 (as in effect immediately after the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) or section 1104(d) of this title with respect to any distribution of residual assets of a single-employer plan to the employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &#8220;seller&#8221;) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &#8220;purchaser&#8221;), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the purchaser&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when due,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If all, or substantially all, of the seller's assets are distributed, or if the seller is liquidated before the end of the 5 plan year period described in paragraph (1)(C), then the seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the seller would have had but for this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If only a portion of the seller's assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may by regulation vary the standards in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section if the variance would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the variance or exemption,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws is the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan's unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, as determined under paragraph (2),</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The unamortized amount of the unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, is the amount of the unfunded vested benefits as of the end of that plan year reduced by 5 percent of such amount for each succeeding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of a change in unfunded vested benefits is the product of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the unamortized amount of such change (as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws); multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for each plan year ending before the plan year in which the employer withdrew from the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for a plan year is the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any amount which the plan sponsor determines in that plan year to be uncollectible for reasons arising out of cases or proceedings under title 11, or similar proceedings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any amount which the plan sponsor determines in that plan year will not be assessed as a result of the operation of section 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), or 1405 of this title against an employer to whom a notice described in section 1399 of this title has been sent, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any amount which the plan sponsor determines to be uncollectible or unassessable in that plan year for other reasons under standards not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the product of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws); multiplied by</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment of multiemployer plan for determination respecting amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan; factors determining computation of amount</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A multiemployer plan, other than a plan which primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, may be amended to provide that the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from the plan is an amount determined under paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, rather than under subsection (b) or (d) of this section. A plan described in section 1383(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) may be amended, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, to provide that the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer not described in section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title shall be determined in a manner different from that provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, reduced as if those obligations were being fully amortized in level annual installments over 15 years beginning with the first plan year ending on or after such date; multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, by all employers who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980, and who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an amount equal to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the sum of the value as of such date of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected, with respect to employers withdrawing before such plan year, and that portion of the amount determined under subparagraph (B)(i) which is allocable to employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and who also had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980; multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan by the employer for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer who withdrew from the plan under this part during those plan years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is the product of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less the value as of the end of such year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers withdrawing before such year; multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed to the plan during those plan years by employers who withdrew from the plan under this section during those plan years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is equal to the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants&#8217; service with the employer (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the employer's proportional share of any unfunded vested benefits which are not attributable to service with the employer or other employers who are obligated to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants&#8217; service with the employer is the amount equal to the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan which are attributable to participants&#8217; service with such employer (determined under plan rules not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation) decreased by the share of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) which is allocated to the employer as provided under subparagraph (D).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The value of plan assets determined under this subparagraph is the value of plan assets allocated to nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, which is determined by multiplying&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the value of the plan assets as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the value of nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with such employers, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as of the end of the plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The share of plan assets, determined under subparagraph (C), which is allocated to the employer shall be determined in accordance with one of the following methods which shall be adopted by the plan by amendment:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employer, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with all employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan by the employer for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan (for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years) by all employers who have an obligation to contribute to the plan for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) by multiplying the value of plan assets under subparagraph (C) by a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(I) of this subparagraph, less the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(I) which are attributable to service with the employer; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(II) of this subparagraph, reduced by the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(II) which are attributable to service with respect to the employers described in such clause (ii)(II).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) The amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year preceding the plan year in which an employer withdraws, which is not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which such employer withdraws, is equal to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an amount equal to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the value of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected with respect to employers withdrawing before the year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) The employer's proportional share described in subparagraph (A)(ii) for a plan year is the amount determined under subparagraph (E) for the employer, but not in excess of an amount which bears the same ratio to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (E) for all employers under the plan as the amount determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer bears to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (C) for all employers under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G) The corporation may prescribe by regulation other methods which a plan may adopt for allocating assets to determine the amount of the unfunded vested benefits attributable to service with the employer and to determine the employer's share of unfunded vested benefits not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year in which the employer withdraws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may, by amendment, adopt any other alternative method for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of the method by the plan would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation standard approaches for alternative methods, other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, which a plan may adopt under subparagraph (A), for which the corporation may waive or modify the approval requirements of subparagraph (A). Any alternative method shall provide for the allocation of substantially all of a plan's unfunded vested benefits among employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Unless the corporation by regulation provides otherwise, a plan may be amended to provide that a period of more than 5 but not more than 10 plan years may be used for determining the numerator and denominator of any fraction which is used under any method authorized under this section for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Method of calculating allocable share of employer of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) of this section; applicability of certain statutory provisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The method of calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) of this section shall be the method for calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under a plan to which section 404(c) of title 26, or a continuation of such a plan, applies, unless the plan is amended to adopt another method authorized under subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Sections 1384, 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), and 1405 of this title shall not apply with respect to the withdrawal of an employer from a plan described in paragraph (1) unless the plan is amended to provide that any of such sections apply.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction of liability of withdrawn employer in case of transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to withdrawal or partial withdrawal of employer</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to an employer's withdrawal or partial withdrawal, the withdrawn employer's liability under this part shall be reduced in an amount equal to the value, as of the end of the last plan year ending on or before the date of the withdrawal, of the transferred unfunded vested benefits.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Computations applicable in case of withdrawal following merger of multiemployer plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a withdrawal following a merger of multiemployer plans, subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall be applied in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation; except that, if a withdrawal occurs in the first plan year beginning after a merger of multiemployer plans, the determination under this section shall be made as if each of the multiemployer plans had remained separate plans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the minimum contribution requirement under section 1423 of this title (before the application of section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title) the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title and without regard to this section).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of overburden status of plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount equal to the total contributions received by the plan during the plan year divided by the average number of active employees who were participants in the plan during the plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulation provide alternative methods of determining active participants where (by reason of irregular employment, contributions on a unit basis, or otherwise) this paragraph does not yield a representative basis for determining the credit.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2102 &#183; Notice required before plant closings and mass layoffs</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to employees, State dislocated worker units, and local governments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">An employer shall not order a plant closing or mass layoff until the end of a 60-day period after the employer serves written notice of such an order&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to each representative of the affected employees as of the time of the notice or, if there is no such representative at that time, to each affected employee; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reduction of notification period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) An employer may order the shutdown of a single site of employment before the conclusion of the 60-day period if as of the time that notice would have been required the employer was actively seeking capital or business which, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown and the employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An employer may order a plant closing or mass layoff before the conclusion of the 60-day period if the closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) No notice under this chapter shall be required if the plant closing or mass layoff is due to any form of natural disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, or the drought currently ravaging the farmlands of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) An employer relying on this subsection shall give as much notice as is practicable and at that time shall give a brief statement of the basis for reducing the notification period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of layoff period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A layoff of more than 6 months which, at its outset, was announced to be a layoff of 6 months or less, shall be treated as an employment loss under this chapter unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the extension beyond 6 months is caused by business circumstances (including unforeseeable changes in price or cost) not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension beyond 6 months will be required.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determinations with respect to employment loss</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, in determining whether a plant closing or mass layoff has occurred or will occur, employment losses for 2 or more groups at a single site of employment, each of which is less than the minimum number of employees specified in section 2101(a)(2) or (3) of this title but which in the aggregate exceed that minimum number, and which occur within any 90-day period shall be considered to be a plant closing or mass layoff unless the employer demonstrates that the employment losses are the result of separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by the employer to evade the requirements of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the closing or layoff constitutes a strike or constitutes a lockout not intended to evade the requirements of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall require an employer to serve written notice pursuant to section 2102(a) of this title when permanently replacing a person who is deemed to be an economic striker under the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.]: Provided, That nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to validate or invalidate any judicial or administrative ruling relating to the hiring of permanent replacements for economic strikers under the National Labor Relations Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the final regular rate received by such employee; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) benefits under an employee benefit plan described in section 1002(3) of this title, including the cost of medical expenses incurred during the employment loss which would have been covered under an employee benefit plan if the employment loss had not occurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Such liability shall be calculated for the period of the violation, up to a maximum of 60 days, but in no event for more than one-half the number of days the employee was employed by the employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount for which an employer is liable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any wages paid by the employer to the employee for the period of the violation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an employer which has violated this chapter proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission that violated this chapter was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of this chapter the court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of the liability or penalty provided for in this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A person seeking to enforce such liability, including a representative of employees or a unit of local government aggrieved under paragraph (1) or (3), may sue either for such person or for other persons similarly situated, or both, in any district court of the United States for any district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, or in which the employer transacts business.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any such suit, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2501 &#183; Findings; statement of purpose</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) American businesses now and for the remainder of the 20th century will face a dramatically different labor market than the one to which they have become accustomed;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) two in every three new entrants to the work force will be women, and to meet labor needs such women must work in all occupational areas including in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) women face significant barriers to their full and effective participation in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the business community must be prepared to address the barriers that women have to such jobs, in order to successfully integrate them into the work force; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) few resources are available to employers and unions who need assistance in recruiting, training, and retaining women in apprenticeable occupations and other nontraditional occupations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to provide technical assistance to employers and labor unions to encourage employment of women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations. Such assistance will enable business to meet the challenge of Workforce 2000 by preparing employers to successfully recruit, train, and retain women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations and will expand the employment and self-sufficiency options of women. This purpose will be achieved by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promoting the program to employers and labor unions to inform them of the availability of technical assistance which will assist them in preparing the workplace to employ women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing grants to community-based organizations to deliver technical assistance to employers and labor unions to prepare them to recruit, train, and employ women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2601 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of single-parent households and two-parent households in which the single parent or both parents work is increasing significantly;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is important for the development of children and the family unit that fathers and mothers be able to participate in early childrearing and the care of family members who have serious health conditions;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) employment standards that apply to one gender only have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this Act&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons (including maternity-related disability) and for compelling family reasons, on a gender-neutral basis; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men, pursuant to such clause.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2701 &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In an increasingly competitive world economy, the companies and nations that lead in the rapid development, commercialization, and application of new and advanced technologies, and in the high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services, will lead in economic growth, employment, and high living standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) While the United States remains the world leader in science and invention, it has not done well in rapidly making the transition from achievement in its research laboratories to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services. This lag and the unprecedented competitive challenge that the United States has faced from abroad have contributed to a drop in real wages and living standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Companies that are successfully competitive in the rapid development, commercialization, application, and implementation of advanced technologies, and in the successful delivery of goods and services, recognize that worker participation and labor-management cooperation in the deployment, application, and implementation of advanced workplace technologies make an important contribution to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services and in maintaining and improving real wages for workers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Federal Government has an important role in encouraging and augmenting private sector efforts relating to the development, application, manufacture, and deployment of new and advanced technologies. The role should be to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) work with private companies, States, worker organizations, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education to ensure the development, application, production, and implementation of new and advanced technologies to promote the improvement of workers&#8217; skills, wages, job security, and working conditions, and a healthy environment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) encourage worker and worker organization participation in the development, commercialization, evaluation, selection, application, and implementation of new and advanced technologies in the workplace; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promote the use and integration of new and advanced technologies in the workplace that enhance workers&#8217; skills.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In working with the private sector to promote the technological leadership and economic growth of the United States, the Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that Federal technology programs help the United States to remain competitive and to maintain and improve living standards and to create and retain secure jobs in economically stable communities.</p>

<h3 class="chapter-head">Chapter 31. Assistive Technology for Individuals With Disabilities</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;3001 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Over 54,000,000 individuals in the United States have disabilities, with almost half experiencing severe disabilities that affect their ability to see, hear, communicate, reason, walk, or perform other basic life functions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) live independently;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enjoy self-determination and make choices;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) benefit from an education;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) pursue meaningful careers; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of society in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Technology is one of the primary engines for economic activity, education, and innovation in the Nation, and throughout the world. The commitment of the United States to the development and utilization of technology is one of the main factors underlying the strength and vibrancy of the economy of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) As technology has come to play an increasingly important role in the lives of all persons in the United States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of government, in the fostering of communication, in the conduct of commerce, and in the provision of education, its impact upon the lives of individuals with disabilities in the United States has been comparable to its impact upon the remainder of the citizens of the United States. Any development in mainstream technology will have profound implications for individuals with disabilities in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Substantial progress has been made in the development of assistive technology devices, including adaptations to existing devices that facilitate activities of daily living that significantly benefit individuals with disabilities of all ages. These devices, including adaptations, increase involvement in, and reduce expenditures associated with, programs and activities that facilitate communication, ensure independent functioning, enable early childhood development, support educational achievement, provide and enhance employment options, and enable full participation in community living for individuals with disabilities. Access to such devices can also reduce expenditures associated with early childhood intervention, education, rehabilitation and training, health care, employment, residential living, independent living, recreation opportunities, and other aspects of daily living.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Over the last 15 years, the Federal Government has invested in the development of comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related assistance, which have proven effective in assisting individuals with disabilities in accessing assistive technology devices and assistive technology services. This partnership between the Federal Government and the States provided an important service to individuals with disabilities by strengthening the capacity of each State to assist individuals with disabilities of all ages meet their assistive technology needs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Despite the success of the Federal-State partnership in providing access to assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, there is a continued need to provide information about the availability of assistive technology, advances in improving accessibility and functionality of assistive technology, and appropriate methods to secure and utilize assistive technology in order to maximize the independence and participation of individuals with disabilities in society.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The combination of significant recent changes in Federal policy (including changes to section 794d of this title, accessibility provisions of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 15301 et seq.), and the amendments made to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001) and the rapid and unending evolution of technology require a Federal-State investment in State assistive technology systems to continue to ensure that individuals with disabilities reap the benefits of the technological revolution and participate fully in life in their communities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to support State efforts to improve the provision of assistive technology to individuals with disabilities through comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related assistance, for individuals with disabilities of all ages, that are designed to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase the ability of individuals with disabilities of all ages to secure and maintain possession of assistive technology devices as such individuals make the transition between services offered by educational or human service agencies or between settings of daily living (for example, between home and work);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase the capacity of public agencies and private entities to provide and pay for assistive technology devices and assistive technology services on a statewide basis for individuals with disabilities of all ages;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) increase the involvement of individuals with disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in decisions related to the provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) increase and promote coordination among State agencies, between State and local agencies, among local agencies, and between State and local agencies and private entities (such as managed care providers), that are involved or are eligible to be involved in carrying out activities under this chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increase the awareness and facilitate the change of laws, regulations, policies, practices, procedures, and organizational structures, that facilitate the availability or provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) increase awareness and knowledge of the benefits of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services among targeted individuals and entities and the general population; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide States with financial assistance that supports programs designed to maximize the ability of individuals with disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives to obtain assistive technology devices and assistive technology services.</p>
