<h3 class="section-head">&#167;80q &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is no national museum devoted exclusively to the history and art of cultures indigenous to the Americas;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) although the Smithsonian Institution sponsors extensive Native American programs, none of its 19 museums, galleries, and major research facilities is devoted exclusively to Native American history and art;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Heye Museum in New York, New York, one of the largest Native American collections in the world, has more than 1,000,000 art objects and artifacts and a library of 40,000 volumes relating to the archaeology, ethnology, and history of Native American peoples;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Heye Museum is housed in facilities with a total area of 90,000 square feet, but requires a minimum of 400,000 square feet for exhibition, storage, and scholarly research;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the bringing together of the Heye Museum collection and the Native American collection of the Smithsonian Institution would&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) create a national institution with unrivaled capability for exhibition and research;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) give all Americans the opportunity to learn of the cultural legacy, historic grandeur, and contemporary culture of Native Americans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide facilities for scholarly meetings and the performing arts;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) make available curatorial and other learning opportunities for Indians; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) make possible traveling exhibitions to communities throughout the Nation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) by order of the Surgeon General of the Army, approximately 4,000 Indian human remains from battlefields and burial sites were sent to the Army Medical Museum and were later transferred to the Smithsonian Institution;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) through archaeological excavations, individual donations, and museum donations, the Smithsonian Institution has acquired approximately 14,000 additional Indian human remains;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the human remains referred to in paragraphs (6) and (7) have long been a matter of concern for many Indian tribes, including Alaska Native Villages, and Native Hawaiian communities which are determined to provide an appropriate resting place for their ancestors;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) identification of the origins of such human remains is essential to addressing that concern; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) an extraordinary site on the National Mall in the District of Columbia (U.S. Government Reservation No. 6) is reserved for the use of the Smithsonian Institution and is available for construction of the National Museum of the American Indian.</p>

(A) Such appropriation shall be expended by the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind each year in manufacturing and furnishing books and other materials specially adapted for instruction of the blind; and the total amount of such books and other materials so manufactured and furnished by such appropriation shall each year be distributed among all the public and private nonprofit institutions in the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, in which blind pupils are educated. Each public and private nonprofit institution for the education of the blind shall receive, in books and other materials, upon requisition of its superintendent, that portion of the appropriation as is shown by the ratio between the number of blind pupils in that institution and the total number of blind pupils in all of the public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated. Each chief State school officer shall receive, in books and other materials, upon requisition, that portion of the appropriation as is shown by the ratio between the number of blind pupils in public and private nonprofit institutions (in the State) in which blind pupils are educated, other than institutions to which the preceding sentence is applicable, and the total number of blind pupils in the public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated in all of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. The ratio referred to in each of the two immediately preceding sentences shall be computed upon the first Monday in January of each year; and for purposes of such sentences the number of blind pupils in public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated shall be authenticated in such manner and as often as the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind shall require. For purposes of sections 101, 102, and 104 of this title, an institution for the education of the blind is any institution which provides education exclusively for the blind, or exclusively for the blind and other handicapped children (in which case special classes are provided for the blind); the chief State school officer of a State is the superintendent of public elementary and secondary schools in such State or, if there is none, such other official as the Governor certifies to have comparable responsibility in the State; and a blind pupil is a blind individual pursuing a course of study in an institution of less than college grade.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The portion of the appropriation received by each chief State school officer, in such books and other materials under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph which represents the number of blind pupils in private nonprofit institutions in such State in which blind pupils are educated shall be distributed among such institutions on the basis of the number of blind pupils in each such institution as compared to the total number of such pupils in all of the private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated in such State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) All books and other materials furnished pursuant to sections 101, 102, and 104 of this title, and control and administration of their use, shall vest only in a public agency. Such books and materials made available pursuant to sections 101, 102 and 104 of this title for use of teachers and blind pupils in any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia in any school shall be limited to those books and materials which have been approved by an appropriate educational authority or agency of such State, Territory, possession, Commonwealth, or District, or any local educational authority thereof, for use, or are used, in a public elementary or secondary school therein.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Buildings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Second. No part of the appropriation shall be expended in the erection or leasing of buildings; but the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind may use each year a reasonable sum of the annual appropriation for salaries and other expenses of experts and other staff to assist special committees which may be appointed in performance of their functions, and for expenses of such special committees.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sales of books and apparatus at cost</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Third. No profit shall be put on any books or tangible apparatus for the instruction of the blind manufactured or furnished by the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky; and the price put upon each article so manufactured or furnished shall only be its actual cost.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income withheld when not properly used</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fourth. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall have the authority to withhold the appropriation whenever he shall receive satisfactory proof that the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky, are not using the appropriation for the benefit of the blind in the public and private nonprofit institutions for the education of the blind in the United States.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Bond of treasurer</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fifth. Before any money be paid to the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind shall execute a bond, with two approved sureties, to the amount of $20,000, conditioned that the money so received shall be expended according to this law and all amendments thereto, which shall be held by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, and shall be renewed every two years.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Ex officio trustees</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Sixth. The superintendent of each public institution for the education of the blind (or his designee) and the chief State school officer (or his designee), of each State and possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, shall each, ex officio, be a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind only for purposes of administering sections 101, 102 and 104 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;107 &#183; Operation of vending facilities</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of providing blind persons with remunerative employment, enlarging the economic opportunities of the blind, and stimulating the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves self-supporting, blind persons licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall be authorized to operate vending facilities on any Federal property.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preferences regulations; justification for limitation on operation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In authorizing the operation of vending facilities on Federal property, priority shall be given to blind persons licensed by a State agency as provided in this chapter; and the Secretary, through the Commissioner, shall, after consultation with the Administrator of General Services and other heads of departments, agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal property, prescribe regulations designed to assure that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the priority under this subsection is given to such licensed blind persons (including assignment of vending machine income pursuant to section 107d&#8211;3 of this title to achieve and protect such priority), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) wherever feasible, one or more vending facilities are established on all Federal property to the extent that any such facility or facilities would not adversely affect the interests of the United States.</p>

Such licenses shall be issued only to applicants who are blind within the meaning of section 107e of this title.</p>

Each such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide notice to the appropriate State licensing agency of its plans for occupation, acquisition, renovation, or relocation of a building adequate to permit such State agency to determine whether such building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply (A) when the Secretary and the State licensing agency determine that the number of people using the property is or will be insufficient to support a vending facility, or (B) to any privately owned building, any part of which is leased by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States and in which, (i) prior to the execution of such lease, the lessor or any of his tenants had in operation a restaurant or other food facility in a part of the building not included in such lease, and (ii) the operation of such a vending facility by a blind person would be in proximate and substantial direct competition with such restaurant or other food facility except that each such department, agency, and instrumentality shall make every effort to lease property in privately owned buildings capable of accommodating a vending facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;satisfactory site&#8221; means an area determined by the Secretary to have sufficient space, electrical and plumbing outlets, and such other facilities as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall insure compliance with this section with respect to buildings, installations, and facilities under his control, and shall be responsible for collection of, and accounting for, such vending machine income.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Existing arrangements more favorable to blind licensees unaffected</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Need for training and research related to community development</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the rapid expansion of the Nation's urban areas and urban population has caused severe problems in urban and suburban development and created a national need to (1) provide special training in skills needed for economic and efficient community development, and (2) support research in new or improved methods of dealing with community development problems.</p>

<h3 class="chapter-head">Chapter 26. Support and Scholarship in Humanities and Arts; Museum Services</h3>

<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter I&#8212;National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;951 &#183; Declaration of findings and purposes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The arts and the humanities belong to all the people of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The encouragement and support of national progress and scholarship in the humanities and the arts, while primarily a matter for private and local initiative, are also appropriate matters of concern to the Federal Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone, but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens. It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) It is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to complement, assist, and add to programs for the advancement of the humanities and the arts by local, State, regional, and private agencies and their organizations. In doing so, the Government must be sensitive to the nature of public sponsorship. Public funding of the arts and humanities is subject to the conditions that traditionally govern the use of public money. Such funding should contribute to public support and confidence in the use of taxpayer funds. Public funds provided by the Federal Government must ultimately serve public purposes the Congress defines.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The arts and the humanities reflect the high place accorded by the American people to the nation's rich cultural heritage and to the fostering of mutual respect for the diverse beliefs and values of all persons and groups.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The practice of art and the study of the humanities require constant dedication and devotion. While no government can call a great artist or scholar into existence, it is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to help create and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry but also the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The world leadership which has come to the United States cannot rest solely upon superior power, wealth, and technology, but must be solidly founded upon worldwide respect and admiration for the Nation's high qualities as a leader in the realm of ideas and of the spirit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Americans should receive in school, background and preparation in the arts and humanities to enable them to recognize and appreciate the aesthetic dimensions of our lives, the diversity of excellence that comprises our cultural heritage, and artistic and scholarly expression.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) It is vital to a democracy to honor and preserve its multicultural artistic heritage as well as support new ideas, and therefore it is essential to provide financial assistance to its artists and the organizations that support their work.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) To fulfill its educational mission, achieve an orderly continuation of free society, and provide models of excellence to the American people, the Federal Government must transmit the achievement and values of civilization from the past via the present to the future, and make widely available the greatest achievements of art.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) In order to implement these findings and purposes, it is desirable to establish a National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are a significant number of institutions of higher education serving high percentages of minority students and students from low-income backgrounds, that face problems that threaten their ability to survive;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the problems relate to the management and fiscal operations of certain institutions of higher education, as well as to an inability to engage in long-range planning and development activities, including endowment building;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in order to be competitive and provide a high-quality education for all, institutions of higher education should improve their technological capacity and make effective use of technology;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the subchapter III program prior to 1985 did not always meet the specific development needs of historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions with large concentrations of minority, low-income students;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the solution of the problems of these institutions would enable them to become viable, fiscally stable and independent, thriving institutions of higher education;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) providing assistance to eligible institutions will enhance the role of such institutions in providing access and quality education to low-income and minority students;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) these institutions play an important role in the American system of higher education, and there is a strong national interest in assisting them in solving their problems and in stabilizing their management and fiscal operations, and in becoming financially independent; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) there is a particular national interest in aiding those institutions of higher education that have historically served students who have been denied access to postsecondary education because of race or national origin and whose participation in the American system of higher education is in the Nation's interest so that equality of access and quality of postsecondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all students.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to assist such institutions in equalizing educational opportunity through a program of Federal assistance.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1060 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the historically Black colleges and universities have contributed significantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through postsecondary education for Black, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged Americans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) States and the Federal Government have discriminated in the allocation of land and financial resources to support Black public institutions under the Morrill Act of 1862 [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and its progeny, and against public and private Black colleges and universities in the award of Federal grants and contracts, and the distribution of Federal resources under this chapter and other Federal programs which benefit institutions of higher education;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the current state of Black colleges and universities is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational opportunity; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) financial assistance to establish or strengthen the physical plants, financial management, academic resources, and endowments of the historically Black colleges and universities are appropriate methods to enhance these institutions and facilitate a decrease in reliance on governmental financial support and to encourage reliance on endowments and private sources.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1066 &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a significant part of the Federal mission in education has been to attain equal opportunity in higher education for low-income, educationally disadvantaged Americans and African Americans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Nation's historically Black colleges and universities have played a prominent role in American history and have an unparalleled record of fostering the development of African American youth by recognizing their potential, enhancing their academic and technical skills, and honing their social and political skills through higher education;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the academic and residential facilities on the campuses of all historically Black colleges and universities have suffered from neglect, deferred maintenance and are in need of capital improvements in order to provide appropriate settings for learning and social development through higher education;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) due to their small enrollments, limited endowments and other financial factors normally considered by lenders in construction financing, historically Black colleges and universities often lack access to the sources of funding necessary to undertake the necessary capital improvements through borrowing and bond financing;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) despite their track record of long-standing and remarkable institutional longevity and viability, historically Black colleges and universities often lack the financial resources necessary to gain access to traditional sources of capital financing such as bank loans and bond financing; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Federal assistance to facilitate low-cost capital basis for historically Black colleges and universities will enable such colleges and universities to continue and expand their educational mission and enhance their significant role in American higher education.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1067 &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support the technological and economic competitiveness of the United States by improving and expanding the scientific and technological capacity of the United States. More and better prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed to improve and expand such capacity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) As the Nation's population becomes more diverse, it is important that the educational and training needs of all Americans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields diminishes our Nation's competitiveness by impairing the quantity of well prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts in these fields.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority institutions provide an important educational opportunity for minority students, particularly in science and engineering fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address the underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving science and engineering programs at minority institutions as such programs lag behind in program offerings and in student enrollment compared to such programs at other institutions of higher education.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program authority and method of distribution</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each fiscal year through fiscal year 2004, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with section 1091 of this title) for each academic year during which that student is in attendance at an institution of higher education, as an undergraduate, a Federal Pell Grant in the amount for which that student is eligible, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Not less than 85 percent of such sums shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students until such time as the Secretary determines and publishes in the Federal Register with an opportunity for comment, an alternative payment system that provides payments to institutions in an accurate and timely manner,,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Grants made under this subpart shall be known as &#8220;Federal Pell Grants&#8221;.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose and amount of grants</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The purpose of this subpart is to provide a Federal Pell Grant that in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and supplemented by the programs authorized under subparts 3 and 4 of this part, will meet at least 75 percent of a student's cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087ll of this title), unless the institution determines that a greater amount of assistance would better serve the purposes of section 1070&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the Federal Pell Grant for a student eligible under this part shall be&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $4,500 for academic year 1999&#8211;2000;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) $5,800 for academic year 2003&#8211;2004,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">less an amount equal to the amount determined to be the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where a student attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (including a student who attends an institution of higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any academic year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to which that student is entitled shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this division, computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance with section 1089 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For any academic year for which an appropriation Act provides a maximum basic grant in an amount in excess of $2,700, the amount of a student's basic grant shall equal $2,700 plus&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) one-half of the amount by which such maximum basic grant exceeds $2,700; plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the lesser of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the remaining one-half of such excess; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) An institution that charged only fees in lieu of tuition as of October 1, 1998, may include in the institution's determination of tuition charged, fees that would normally constitute tuition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) No Federal Pell Grant under this subpart shall exceed the difference between the expected family contribution for a student and the cost of attendance (as defined in section 1087ll of this title) at the institution at which that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student, it is determined that the amount of a Federal Pell Grant plus the amount of the expected family contribution for that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant shall be reduced until the combination of expected family contribution and the amount of the Federal Pell Grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at such institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) No Federal Pell Grant shall be awarded to a student under this subpart if the amount of that grant for that student as determined under this subsection for any academic year is less than $400, except that a student who is eligible for a Federal Pell Grant that is equal to or greater than $200 but less than $400 shall be awarded a Federal Pell Grant of $400.</p>

If the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad program, rather than the home institution's cost, to determine the cost of attendance of the student.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) No Federal Pell Grant shall be awarded under this subpart to any individual who is incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of eligibility for grants</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The period during which a student may receive Federal Pell Grants shall be the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student at the institution at which the student is in attendance except that any period during which the student is enrolled in a noncredit or remedial course of study as defined in paragraph (2) shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>

Nothing in this section shall exclude from eligibility programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at which the student is enrolled.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) No student is entitled to receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one institution or from the Secretary and an institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive a Federal Pell Grant if the student&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is carrying at least one-half the normal full-time work load for the course of study the student is pursuing, as determined by the institution of higher education; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in a postbaccalaureate program that does not lead to a graduate degree, and in courses required by a State in order for the student to receive a professional certification or licensing credential that is required for employment as a teacher in an elementary school or secondary school in that State,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">except that this paragraph shall not apply to a student who is enrolled in an institution of higher education that offers a baccalaureate degree in education.</p>

The student may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and services by crediting the student's account.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Calculation of eligibility</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart (including a central processor, if any, designated by the Secretary) shall, in a timely manner, furnish to the student financial aid administrator (at each institution of higher education which a student awarded a Federal Pell Grant under this subpart is attending), as a part of its regular output document, the expected family contribution for each such student. Each such student financial aid administrator shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) examine and assess the data used to calculate the expected family contribution of the student furnished pursuant to this subsection;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recalculate the expected family contribution of the student if there has been a change in circumstances of the student or in the data submitted;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make the award to the student in the correct amount; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) after making such award report the corrected data to such contractor and to a central processor (if any) designated by the Secretary for a confirmation of the correct computation of amount of the expected family contribution for each such student.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a student receives an award under this subpart that, due to recalculation errors by the institution of higher education, is in excess of the amount which the student is entitled to receive under this subpart, such institution of higher education shall pay to the Secretary the amount of such excess unless such excess can be resolved in a subsequent disbursement to the institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each contractor processing applications for awards under this subpart shall for each academic year after academic year 1986&#8211;1987 prepare and submit a report to the Secretary on the correctness of the computations of amount of the expected family contribution, and on the accuracy of the questions on the application form under this subpart for the previous academic year for which the contractor is responsible.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Use of excess funds</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by 15 percent or less, then all of the excess funds shall remain available for making payments under this subpart during the next succeeding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the funds available for making payments under this subpart exceed the amount necessary to make the payments required under this subpart to eligible students by more than 15 percent, then all of such funds shall remain available for making such payments but payments may be made under this paragraph only with respect to entitlements for that fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treatment of institutions and students under other laws</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any institution of higher education which enters into an agreement with the Secretary to disburse to students attending that institution the amounts those students are eligible to receive under this subpart shall not be deemed, by virtue of such agreement, a contractor maintaining a system of records to accomplish a function of the Secretary. Recipients of Pell Grants shall not be considered to be individual grantees for purposes of subtitle D of title V of Public Law 100&#8211;690 [41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.].</p>
