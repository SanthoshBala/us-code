<p class="statutory-body">Whereas under prevailing economic conditions, developed with the aid of governmental authority for owners of property to organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; therefore, the following definitions of and limitations upon the jurisdiction and authority of the courts of the United States are enacted.</p>

Such a temporary restraining order shall be effective for no longer than five days and shall become void at the expiration of said five days. No temporary restraining order or temporary injunction shall be issued except on condition that complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate security in an amount to be fixed by the court sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss, expense, or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction, including all reasonable costs (together with a reasonable attorney's fee) and expense of defense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The undertaking mentioned in this section shall be understood to signify an agreement entered into by the complainant and the surety upon which a decree may be rendered in the same suit or proceeding against said complainant and surety, upon a hearing to assess damages of which hearing complainant and surety shall have reasonable notice, the said complainant and surety submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for that purpose. But nothing in this section contained shall deprive any party having a claim or cause of action under or upon such undertaking from electing to pursue his ordinary remedy by suit at law or in equity.</p>

<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter II&#8212;National Labor Relations</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;151 &#183; Findings and declaration of policy</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (a) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (b) occurring in the current of commerce; (c) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods from or into the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (d) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing from or into the channels of commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment, or interruption, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, by encouraging practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and by restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Experience has further demonstrated that certain practices by some labor organizations, their officers, and members have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by preventing the free flow of goods in such commerce through strikes and other forms of industrial unrest or through concerted activities which impair the interest of the public in the free flow of such commerce. The elimination of such practices is a necessary condition to the assurance of the rights herein guaranteed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is declared hereby to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Obligation to bargain collectively</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession: Provided, That where there is in effect a collective-bargaining contract covering employees in an industry affecting commerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) serves a written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification sixty days prior to the expiration date thereof, or in the event such contract contains no expiration date, sixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) continues in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lock-out, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The duties imposed upon employers, employees, and labor organizations by paragraphs (2) to (4) of this subsection shall become inapplicable upon an intervening certification of the Board, under which the labor organization or individual, which is a party to the contract, has been superseded as or ceased to be the representative of the employees subject to the provisions of section 159(a) of this title, and the duties so imposed shall not be construed as requiring either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period, if such modification is to become effective before such terms and conditions can be reopened under the provisions of the contract. Any employee who engages in a strike within any notice period specified in this subsection, or who engages in any strike within the appropriate period specified in subsection (g) of this section, shall lose his status as an employee of the employer engaged in the particular labor dispute, for the purposes of sections 158, 159, and 160 of this title, but such loss of status for such employee shall terminate if and when he is reemployed by such employer. Whenever the collective bargaining involves employees of a health care institution, the provisions of this subsection shall be modified as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) After notice is given to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service under either clause (A) or (B) of this sentence, the Service shall promptly communicate with the parties and use its best efforts, by mediation and conciliation, to bring them to agreement. The parties shall participate fully and promptly in such meetings as may be undertaken by the Service for the purpose of aiding in a settlement of the dispute.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforceability of contract or agreement to boycott any other employer; exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such extent unenforcible&#160;Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall apply to an agreement between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work: Provided further, That for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b)(4)(B) of this section the terms &#8220;any employer&#8221;, &#8220;any person engaged in commerce or an industry affecting commerce&#8221;, and &#8220;any person&#8221; when used in relation to the terms &#8220;any other producer, processor, or manufacturer&#8221;, &#8220;any other employer&#8221;, or &#8220;any other person&#8221; shall not include persons in the relation of a jobber, manufacturer, contractor, or subcontractor working on the goods or premises of the jobber or manufacturer or performing parts of an integrated process of production in the apparel and clothing industry: Provided further, That nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the enforcement of any agreement which is within the foregoing exception.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agreement covering employees in the building and construction industry</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall not be an unfair labor practice under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or who, upon their employment, will be engaged) in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in subsection (a) of this section as an unfair labor practice) because (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of section 159 of this title prior to the making of such agreement, or (2) such agreement requires as a condition of employment, membership in such labor organization after the seventh day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of the agreement, whichever is later, or (3) such agreement requires the employer to notify such labor organization of opportunities for employment with such employer, or gives such labor organization an opportunity to refer qualified applicants for such employment, or (4) such agreement specifies minimum training or experience qualifications for employment or provides for priority in opportunities for employment based upon length of service with such employer, in the industry or in the particular geographical area: Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall set aside the final proviso to subsection (a)(3) of this section: Provided further, That any agreement which would be invalid, but for clause (1) of this subsection, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to section 159(c) or 159(e) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Notification of intention to strike or picket at any health care institution</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A labor organization before engaging in any strike, picketing, or other concerted refusal to work at any health care institution shall, not less than ten days prior to such action, notify the institution in writing and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of that intention, except that in the case of bargaining for an initial agreement following certification or recognition the notice required by this subsection shall not be given until the expiration of the period specified in clause (B) of the last sentence of subsection (d) of this section. The notice shall state the date and time that such action will commence. The notice, once given, may be extended by the written agreement of both parties.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of bargaining unit by Board</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall decide in each case whether, in order to assure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this subchapter, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof: Provided, That the Board shall not (1) decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit; or (2) decide that any craft unit is inappropriate for such purposes on the ground that a different unit has been established by a prior Board determination, unless a majority of the employees in the proposed craft unit vote against separate representation or (3) decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes if it includes, together with other employees, any individual employed as a guard to enforce against employees and other persons rules to protect property of the employer or to protect the safety of persons on the employer's premises; but no labor organization shall be certified as the representative of employees in a bargaining unit of guards if such organization admits to membership, or is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which admits to membership, employees other than guards.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Complaint and notice of hearing; answer; court rules of evidence inapplicable</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the Board, or any agent or agency designated by the Board for such purposes, shall have power to issue and cause to be served upon such person a complaint stating the charges in that respect, and containing a notice of hearing before the Board or a member thereof, or before a designated agent or agency, at a place therein fixed, not less than five days after the serving of said complaint: Provided, That no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom such charge is made, unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing such charge by reason of service in the armed forces, in which event the six-month period shall be computed from the day of his discharge. Any such complaint may be amended by the member, agent, or agency conducting the hearing or the Board in its discretion at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon. The person so complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the original or amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. In the discretion of the member, agent, or agency conducting the hearing or the Board, any other person may be allowed to intervene in the said proceeding and to present testimony. Any such proceeding shall, so far as practicable, be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of the United States under the rules of civil procedure for the district courts of the United States, adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States pursuant to section 2072 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The testimony taken by such member, agent, or agency or the Board shall be reduced to writing and filed with the Board.

If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the Board shall not be of the opinion that the person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the said complaint. No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause. In case the evidence is presented before a member of the Board, or before an administrative law judge or judges thereof, such member, or such judge or judges as the case may be, shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding a proposed report, together with a recommended order, which shall be filed with the Board, and if no exceptions are filed within twenty days after service thereof upon such parties, or within such further period as the Board may authorize, such recommended order shall become the order of the Board and become effective as therein prescribed.</p>

Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board. No objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, and to be made a part of the record. The Board may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. Upon the filing of the record with it the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the appropriate United States court of appeals if application was made to the district court as hereinabove provided, and by the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Board, and thereupon the aggrieved party shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, certified by the Board, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the Board under subsection (e) of this section, and shall have the same jurisdiction to grant to the Board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and in like manner to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board; the findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall in like manner be conclusive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that the existence, in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (1) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;208 &#183; Wage orders in American Samoa</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional policy; recommendation of wage rate by industry committee</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The policy of this chapter with respect to industries or enterprises in American Samoa engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce is to reach as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment the objective of the minimum wage rate which would apply in each such industry under paragraph (1) or (5) of section 206(a) of this title but for section 206(c)&#160;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigation of industry condition by industry committee; matters considered</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the convening of any such industry committee, the Administrator shall refer to it the question of the minimum wage rate or rates to be fixed for such industry. The industry committee shall investigate conditions in the industry and the committee, or any authorized subcommittee thereof, shall after due notice hear such witnesses and receive such evidence as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the committee to perform its duties and functions under this chapter. The committee shall recommend to the Administrator the highest minimum wage rates for the industry which it determines, having due regard to economic and competitive conditions, will not substantially curtail employment in the industry, and will not give any industry in American Samoa a competitive advantage over any industry in the United States outside of American Samoa; except that the committee shall recommend to the Secretary the minimum wage rate prescribed in section 206(a) or 206(b) of this title, which would be applicable but for section 206(a)(3) of this title, unless there is evidence in the record which establishes that the industry, or a predominant portion thereof, is unable to pay that wage due to such economic and competitive conditions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Classifications within industry; recommendation of wage rate</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The industry committee shall recommend such reasonable classifications within any industry as it determines to be necessary for the purpose of fixing for each classification within such industry the highest minimum wage rate (not in excess of that in effect under paragraph (1) or (5) of section 206(a) of this title (as the case may be)) which (1) will not substantially curtail employment in such classification and (2) will not give a competitive advantage to any group in the industry, and shall recommend for each classification in the industry the highest minimum wage rate which the committee determines will not substantially curtail employment in such classification. In determining whether such classification should be made in any industry, in making such classifications, and in determining the minimum wage rates for such classifications, no classifications shall be made, and no minimum wage rate shall be fixed, solely on a regional basis, but the industry committee shall consider among other relevant factors the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) competitive conditions as affected by transportation, living, and production costs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the wages established for work of like or comparable character by collective labor agreements negotiated between employers and employees by representatives of their own choosing; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the wages paid for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum wage standards in the industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">No classification shall be made under this section on the basis of age or sex.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report by industry committee; publication in Federal Register</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The industry committee shall file with the Secretary a report containing its findings of fact and recommendations with respect to the matters referred to it. Upon the filing of such report, the Secretary shall publish such recommendations in the Federal Register and shall provide by order that the recommendations contained in such report shall take effect upon the expiration of 15 days after the date of such publication.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Orders</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Orders issued under this section shall define the industries and classifications therein to which they are to apply, and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Administrator finds necessary to carry out the purposes of such orders, to prevent the circumvention or evasion thereof, and to safeguard the minimum wage rates established therein.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Due notice of hearings by publication in Federal Register</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Due notice of any hearing provided for in this section shall be given by publication in the Federal Register and by such other means as the Administrator deems reasonably calculated to give general notice to interested persons.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any person aggrieved by an order of the Secretary issued under section 208 of this title may obtain a review of such order in the United States Court of Appeals for any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within 60 days after the entry of such order a written petition praying that the order of the Secretary be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of such petition shall forthwith be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary, and thereupon the Secretary shall file in the court the record of the industry committee upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify (including provision for the payment of an appropriate minimum wage rate), or set aside such order in whole or in part, so far as it is applicable to the petitioner. The review by the court shall be limited to questions of law, and findings of fact by such industry committee when supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive. No objection to the order of the Secretary shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before such industry committee or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence may materially affect the result of the proceeding and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceedings before such industry committee, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before an industry committee and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. Such industry committee may modify the initial findings by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and shall file with the court such modified or new findings which if supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive, and shall also file its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The commencement of proceedings under subsection (a) of this section shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Administrator's order. The court shall not grant any stay of the order unless the person complaining of such order shall file in court an undertaking with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the court for the payment to the employees affected by the order, in the event such order is affirmed, of the amount by which the compensation such employees are entitled to receive under the order exceeds the compensation they actually receive while such stay is in effect.</p>

The Secretary may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation and an equal amount as liquidated damages. The right provided by subsection (b) of this section to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee to recover the liability specified in the first sentence of such subsection and of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary in an action under this subsection in which a recovery is sought of unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under sections 206 and 207 of this title or liquidated or other damages provided by this subsection owing to such employee by an employer liable under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, unless such action is dismissed without prejudice on motion of the Secretary.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended [29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], has been interpreted judicially in disregard of long-established customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees, thereby creating wholly unexpected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation, upon employers with the results that, if said Act as so interpreted or claims arising under such interpretations were permitted to stand, (1) the payment of such liabilities would bring about financial ruin of many employers and seriously impair the capital resources of many others, thereby resulting in the reduction of industrial operations, halting of expansion and development, curtailing employment, and the earning power of employees; (2) the credit of many employers would be seriously impaired; (3) there would be created both an extended and continuous uncertainty on the part of industry, both employer and employee, as to the financial condition of productive establishments and a gross inequality of competitive conditions between employers and between industries; (4) employees would receive windfall payments, including liquidated damages, of sums for activities performed by them without any expectation of reward beyond that included in their agreed rates of pay; (5) there would occur the promotion of increasing demands for payment to employees for engaging in activities no compensation for which had been contemplated by either the employer or employee at the time they were engaged in; (6) voluntary collective bargaining would be interfered with and industrial disputes between employees and employers and between employees and employees would be created; (7) the courts of the country would be burdened with excessive and needless litigation and champertous practices would be encouraged; (8) the Public Treasury would be deprived of large sums of revenues and public finances would be seriously deranged by claims against the Public Treasury for refunds of taxes already paid; (9) the cost to the Government of goods and services heretofore and hereafter purchased by its various departments and agencies would be unreasonably increased and the Public Treasury would be seriously affected by consequent increased cost of war contracts; and (10) serious and adverse effects upon the revenues of Federal, State, and local governments would occur.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that all of the foregoing constitutes a substantial burden on commerce and a substantial obstruction to the free flow of goods in commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that it is in the national public interest and for the general welfare, essential to national defense, and necessary to aid, protect, and foster commerce, that this chapter be enacted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that the varying and extended periods of time for which, under the laws of the several States, potential retroactive liability may be imposed upon employers, have given and will give rise to great difficulties in the sound and orderly conduct of business and industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds and declares that all of the results which have arisen or may arise under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, as aforesaid, may (except as to liability for liquidated damages) arise with respect to the Walsh-Healey [41 U.S.C. 35 et seq.] and Bacon-Davis [40 U.S.C. 276a et seq.] Acts and that it is, therefore, in the national public interest and for the general welfare, essential to national defense, and necessary to aid, protect, and foster commerce, that this chapter shall apply to the Walsh-Healey Act and the Bacon-Davis Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in order to meet the existing emergency and to correct existing evils (1) to relieve and protect interstate commerce from practices which burden and obstruct it; (2) to protect the right of collective bargaining; and (3) to define and limit the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Standards for labor-management relations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that, in the public interest, it continues to be the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect employees&#8217; rights to organize, choose their own representatives, bargain collectively, and otherwise engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection; that the relations between employers and labor organizations and the millions of workers they represent have a substantial impact on the commerce of the Nation; and that in order to accomplish the objective of a free flow of commerce it is essential that labor organizations, employers, and their officials adhere to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of their organizations, particularly as they affect labor-management relations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of rights of employees and the public</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally as they relate to the activities of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Necessity to eliminate or prevent improper practices</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that the enactment of this chapter is necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives which distort and defeat the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended [29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.], and the Railway Labor Act, as amended [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and have the tendency or necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (1) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (2) occurring in the current of commerce; (3) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods into or from the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (4) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing into or from the channels of commerce.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;621 &#183; Congressional statement of findings and purpose</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the face of rising productivity and affluence, older workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment when displaced from jobs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the setting of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance has become a common practice, and certain otherwise desirable practices may work to the disadvantage of older persons;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment with resultant deterioration of skill, morale, and employer acceptability is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers; their numbers are great and growing; and their employment problems grave;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the existence in industries affecting commerce, of arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age, burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.</p>

In order to achieve the purposes of this chapter, the Secretary of Labor shall carry on a continuing program of education and information, under which he may, among other measures&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) undertake research, and promote research, with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older persons, and the promotion of measures for utilizing their skills;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish and otherwise make available to employers, professional societies, the various media of communication, and other interested persons the findings of studies and other materials for the promotion of employment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) foster through the public employment service system and through cooperative effort the development of facilities of public and private agencies for expanding the opportunities and potentials of older persons;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) sponsor and assist State and community informational and educational programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Not later than six months after the effective date of this chapter, the Secretary shall recommend to the Congress any measures he may deem desirable to change the lower or upper age limits set forth in section 631 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Promulgation by Secretary of national consensus standards and established Federal standards; time for promulgation; conflicting standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Without regard to chapter 5 of title 5 or to the other subsections of this section, the Secretary shall, as soon as practicable during the period beginning with the effective date of this chapter and ending two years after such date, by rule promulgate as an occupational safety or health standard any national consensus standard, and any established Federal standard, unless he determines that the promulgation of such a standard would not result in improved safety or health for specifically designated employees. In the event of conflict among any such standards, the Secretary shall promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedure for promulgation, modification, or revocation of standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by rule promulgate, modify, or revoke any occupational safety or health standard in the following manner:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Secretary, upon the basis of information submitted to him in writing by an interested person, a representative of any organization of employers or employees, a nationally recognized standards-producing organization, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or a State or political subdivision, or on the basis of information developed by the Secretary or otherwise available to him, determines that a rule should be promulgated in order to serve the objectives of this chapter, the Secretary may request the recommendations of an advisory committee appointed under section 656 of this title. The Secretary shall provide such an advisory committee with any proposals of his own or of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, together with all pertinent factual information developed by the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or otherwise available, including the results of research, demonstrations, and experiments. An advisory committee shall submit to the Secretary its recommendations regarding the rule to be promulgated within ninety days from the date of its appointment or within such longer or shorter period as may be prescribed by the Secretary, but in no event for a period which is longer than two hundred and seventy days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall publish a proposed rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard in the Federal Register and shall afford interested persons a period of thirty days after publication to submit written data or comments. Where an advisory committee is appointed and the Secretary determines that a rule should be issued, he shall publish the proposed rule within sixty days after the submission of the advisory committee's recommendations or the expiration of the period prescribed by the Secretary for such submission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) On on before the last day of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), any interested person may file with the Secretary written objections to the proposed rule, stating the grounds therefor and requesting a public hearing on such objections. Within thirty days after the last day for filing such objections, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice specifying the occupational safety or health standard to which objections have been filed and a hearing requested, and specifying a time and place for such hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within sixty days after the expiration of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), or within sixty days after the completion of any hearing held under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall issue a rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard or make a determination that a rule should not be issued. Such a rule may contain a provision delaying its effective date for such period (not in excess of ninety days) as the Secretary determines may be necessary to insure that affected employers and employees will be informed of the existence of the standard and of its terms and that employers affected are given an opportunity to familiarize themselves and their employees with the existence of the requirements of the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Any employer may apply to the Secretary for a temporary order granting a variance from a standard or any provision thereof promulgated under this section. Such temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of clause (B) and establishes that (i) he is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date, (ii) he is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and (iii) he has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard as quickly as practicable. Any temporary order issued under this paragraph shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail his program for coming into compliance with the standard. Such a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing: Provided, That the Secretary may issue one interim order to be effective until a decision is made on the basis of the hearing. No temporary order may be in effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve compliance with the standard or one year, whichever is shorter, except that such an order may be renewed not more than twice (I) so long as the requirements of this paragraph are met and (II) if an application for renewal is filed at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the order. No interim renewal of an order may remain in effect for longer than 180 days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) An application for a temporary order under this paragraph (6) shall contain:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a specification of the standard or portion thereof from which the employer seeks a variance,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons having firsthand knowledge of the facts represented, that he is unable to comply with the standard or portion thereof and a detailed statement of the reasons therefor,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a statement of the steps he has taken and will take (with specific dates) to protect employees against the hazard covered by the standard,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a statement of when he expects to be able to comply with the standard and what steps he has taken and what steps he will take (with dates specified) to come into compliance with the standard, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) a certification that he has informed his employees of the application by giving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted, and by other appropriate means.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">A description of how employees have been informed shall be contained in the certification. The information to employees shall also inform them of their right to petition the Secretary for a hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary is authorized to grant a variance from any standard or portion thereof whenever he determines, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies, that such variance is necessary to permit an employer to participate in an experiment approved by him or the Secretary of Health and Human Services designed to demonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of workers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any standard promulgated under this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or other appropriate forms of warning as are necessary to insure that employees are apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed, relevant symptoms and appropriate emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use or exposure. Where appropriate, such standard shall also prescribe suitable protective equipment and control or technological procedures to be used in connection with such hazards and shall provide for monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in such manner as may be necessary for the protection of employees. In addition, where appropriate, any such standard shall prescribe the type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available, by the employer or at his cost, to employees exposed to such hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of such employees is adversely affected by such exposure. In the event such medical examinations are in the nature of research, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, such examinations may be furnished at the expense of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The results of such examinations or tests shall be furnished only to the Secretary or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and, at the request of the employee, to his physician. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may by rule promulgated pursuant to section 553 of title 5, make appropriate modifications in the foregoing requirements relating to the use of labels or other forms of warning, monitoring or measuring, and medical examinations, as may be warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments acquired subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) Whenever a rule promulgated by the Secretary differs substantially from an existing national consensus standard, the Secretary shall, at the same time, publish in the Federal Register a statement of the reasons why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national consensus standard.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Emergency temporary standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall provide, without regard to the requirements of chapter 5 of title 5, for an emergency temporary standard to take immediate effect upon publication in the Federal Register if he determines (A) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and (B) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard promulgated in accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon publication of such standard in the Federal Register the Secretary shall commence a proceeding in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the standard as published shall also serve as a proposed rule for the proceeding. The Secretary shall promulgate a standard under this paragraph no later than six months after publication of the emergency standard as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Variances from standards; procedure</h4>

Affected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The Secretary shall issue such rule or order if he determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard. The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees, or by the Secretary on his own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subsection at any time after six months from its issuance.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Statement of reasons for Secretary's determinations; publication in Federal Register</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Judicial review</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any person who may be adversely affected by a standard issued under this section may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated file a petition challenging the validity of such standard with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review of such standard. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The filing of such petition shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the standard. The determinations of the Secretary shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Priority for establishment of standards</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;718b &#183; Traditionally underserved populations</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VIII of this chapter, the Congress finds as follows:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Racial profile</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The racial profile of America is rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Latinos, 14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year 2000, the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-American.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of disability</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. The rate of work-related disability for American Indians is about one and one-half times that of the general population. African-Americans are also one and one-half times more likely to be disabled than whites and twice as likely to be severely disabled.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inequitable treatment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recruitment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of pre-service training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Outreach to minorities</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Policy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner shall develop a policy to mobilize the resources of the Nation to prepare minorities for careers in vocational rehabilitation, independent living, and related services.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Focus</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">This policy shall focus on&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the recruitment of minorities into the field of vocational rehabilitation counseling and related disciplines; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) financially assisting Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education, and other institutions of higher education whose minority enrollment is at least 50 percent to prepare students for vocational rehabilitation and related service careers.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Plan</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Development</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commissioner shall develop a plan to provide outreach services and other related activities (such as cooperative efforts) to the entities described in subparagraph (B) in order to enhance the capacity and increase the participation of such entities in competitions for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under subchapters I through VIII of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Entities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The entities referred to in subparagraph (A) are&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education, and other institutions of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 50 percent;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) nonprofit and for-profit agencies at least 51 percent owned or controlled by one or more minority individuals; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) underrepresented populations.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Funding</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of implementing the plan required in subparagraph (A), the Commissioner shall, for each of the fiscal years 1993 through 1997, expend 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year involved for carrying out programs authorized in subchapters II through VIII of this chapter, except programs authorized under subchapter IV or V of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effort</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner shall exercise the utmost authority, resourcefulness, and diligence to meet the requirements of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Report</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than January 31 of each year, starting with fiscal year 1994, the Commissioner shall prepare and submit to Congress a final report on the progress toward meeting the goals of this section during the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The report shall include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a full explanation of any progress toward meeting the goals of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a plan to meet the goals, if necessary.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Demonstration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In awarding grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under subchapters I, II, III, VI, VII, and VIII of this chapter, and section 794e of this title, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, where appropriate, shall require applicants to demonstrate how they will address, in whole or in part, the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority backgrounds.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; purpose; policy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) work&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in America;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) reasons for the significant number of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at a level not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) discrimination;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) fear of losing health coverage under the medicare and medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing existing private health insurance; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to enter or retain or advance in employment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the provision of vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating a comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable program of vocational rehabilitation that is designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain gainful employment in integrated settings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Individuals with disabilities must be active participants in their own rehabilitation programs, including making meaningful and informed choices about the selection of their vocational goals and objectives and the vocational rehabilitation services they receive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Families and natural supports can play an important role in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability requests, desires, or needs such supports.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Qualified vocational rehabilitation counselors, other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel facilitate the accomplishment of the employment goals and objectives of an individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Individuals with disabilities and their advocates are full partners in the vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Accountability measures must facilitate and not impede the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most severe disabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be considered to have&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Benefit plans as affecting interstate commerce and the Federal taxing power</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and economic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are affected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate character of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans are carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their operation, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, and to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are afforded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby further declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 93&#8211;406, title I, &#167;2, Sept. 2, 1974, 88 Stat. 832.</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">the amendments made by section 301 shall not apply to plan amendments adopted before April 1, 1985, pursuant to such successor agreements (without regard to any modification or reopening after December 31, 1984).</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">the amendments made by sections 103 and 203 shall be treated as in effect as of the time of such participant's death. In the case of a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan to which this paragraph applies, the plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of the amendments made by sections 103 and 203 with respect to any participant if the plan made a distribution in a form other than a life annuity to the surviving spouse of the participant of such participant's nonforfeitable benefit.</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">then such participant may elect to have section 205 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [section 1055 of this title] and section 401(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [section 401(a)(11) of Title 26] (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act) apply.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1001a &#183; Additional Congressional findings and declaration of policy</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effects of multiemployer pension plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by multiemployer pension plans; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster and facilitate interstate commerce,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to alleviate certain problems which tend to discourage the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide reasonable protection for the interests of participants and beneficiaries of financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide a financially self-sufficient program for the guarantee of employee benefits under multiemployer plans.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1001b &#183; Findings and declaration of policy</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) single-employer defined benefit pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the continued well-being and retirement income security of millions of workers, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by such plans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the existence of a sound termination insurance system is fundamental to the retirement income security of participants and beneficiaries of such plans; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the current termination insurance system in some instances encourages employers to terminate pension plans, evade their obligations to pay benefits, and shift unfunded pension liabilities onto the termination insurance system and the other premium-payers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that modification of the current termination insurance system and an increase in the insurance premium for single-employer defined benefit pension plans&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is desirable to increase the likelihood that full benefits will be paid to participants and beneficiaries of such plans;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is desirable to provide for the transfer of liabilities to the termination insurance system only in cases of severe hardship;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is necessary to maintain the premium costs of such system at a reasonable level; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is necessary to finance properly current funding deficiencies and future obligations of the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Declaration of policy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this title&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster and facilitate interstate commerce;</p>

Such interest shall be computed on such amount at the rate determined for purposes of section 1054(c)(2)(C) of this title (if such subsection applies) on the date of such repayment (computed annually from the date of such withdrawal).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E)(i) A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions under a multiemployer plan shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that benefits accrued as a result of service with the participant's employer before the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan may not be payable if the employer ceases contributions to the multiemployer plan.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1054 &#183; Benefit accrual requirements</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section, and&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enumeration of plan requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the number of years (not in excess of 331/3) of his participation in the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 1331/3 percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &#8220;year of service&#8221; has the meaning provided by section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 1081(b) of this title (relating to certain insurance contract plans),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">but only if an employee's accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 1081(b) of this title were satisfied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant's accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which benefits under the plan&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) do not exceed social security benefits, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) terminate when such social security benefits commence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 1056(a)(3) of this title, and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to section 1053(a)(3)(B) of this title, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of section 414(q) of title 26) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees within the meaning of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(v) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of section 411(b)(1)(H) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this subparagraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(1)(H).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 411(b)(2) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &#8220;year of participation&#8221; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 1052(b) of this title, determined without regard to section 1052(b)(5) of this title) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &#8220;year of participation&#8221; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) For purposes of this subsection in the case of any maritime industry, 125 days of service shall be treated as a year of participation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Employee's accrued benefits derived from employer and employee contributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section and section 1053 of this title an employee's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions as of any applicable date is the excess (if any) of the accrued benefit for such employee as of such applicable date over the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by such employee as of such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a plan other than a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) except as provided in clause (ii), the balance of the employee's separate account consisting only of his contributions and the income, expenses, gains, and losses attributable thereto, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Defined benefit plans.&#8212;In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;accumulated contributions&#8221; means the total of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all mandatory contributions made by the employee,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) interest (if any) under the plan to the end of the last plan year to which section 1053(a)(2) of this title does not apply (by reason of the applicable effective date), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) interest on the sum of the amounts determined under clauses (i) and (ii) compounded annually&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of a plan year for the period beginning with the 1st plan year to which subsection (a)(2) of this section applies by reason of the applicable effective date) and ending with the date on which the determination is being made, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date) for the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on which the employee attains normal retirement age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &#8220;mandatory contributions&#8221; means amounts contributed to the plan by the employee which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plans, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee's accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee's accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Employee service which may be disregarded in determining employee's accrued benefits under plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1053(b)(1) of this title, for purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit under the plan, the plan may disregard service performed by the employee with respect to which he has received&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under section 1053(e)(1) of this title) permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a distribution of the present value of his nonforfeitable benefit attributable to such service which he elected to receive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraph (1) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee's participation in the plan. Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee's participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit, the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) of this section unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) of this section with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section and provides that upon such repayment the employee's accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) resumes employment covered under the plan, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) repays the full amount of such distribution with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) This section shall apply to&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Plans meeting requirements of section</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A plan meets the requirements of this section only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under the plan, each participant&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) may elect at any time during the applicable election period to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit (or both), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe) a written explanation of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within the applicable period with respect to such participant (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation with respect to the qualified preretirement survivor annuity comparable to that required under subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The period beginning with the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the participant attains age 35.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) A reasonable period ending after this section applies to the participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who separates from service before attaining age 35, the applicable period shall be a reasonable period after separation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each plan shall provide that, if this section applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply with respect to the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit, as the case may be, if such benefit may not be waived (or another beneficiary selected) and if the plan fully subsidizes the costs of such benefit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relying on a consent or revocation referred to in paragraph (1)(A), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) making a determination under paragraph (2),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then such consent, revocation, or determination shall be treated as valid for purposes of discharging the plan from liability to the extent of payments made pursuant to such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;applicable election period&#8221; means&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an election to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit, the 90-day period ending on the annuity starting date, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an election to waive the qualified preretirement survivor annuity, the period which begins on the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 35 and ends on the date of the participant's death.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) A plan may provide the written explanation described in paragraph (3)(A) after the annuity starting date. In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the applicable election period under paragraph (7) shall not end before the 30th day after the date on which such explanation is provided.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations limit the application of clause (i), except that such regulations may not limit the period of time by which the annuity starting date precedes the provision of the written explanation other than by providing that the annuity starting date may not be earlier than termination of employment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A plan may permit a participant to elect (with any applicable spousal consent) to waive any requirement that the written explanation be provided at least 30 days before the annuity starting date (or to waive the 30-day requirement under subparagraph (A)) if the distribution commences more than 7 days after such explanation is provided.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1056 &#183; Form and payment of benefits</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement date for payment of benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall provide that unless the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) occurs the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the participant terminates his service with the employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separate from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Decrease in plan benefits by reason of increases in benefit levels under Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act of 1937</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a participant or beneficiary is receiving benefits under a pension plan, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a participant is separated from the service and has non-forfeitable rights to benefits,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">a plan may not decrease benefits of such a participant by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] or any increase in the wage base under such title II, if such increase takes place after September 2, 1974, or (if later) the earlier of the date of first entitlement of such benefits or the date of such separation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forfeiture of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall not be taken into account any voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment, or of any irrevocable assignment or alienation of benefits executed before September 2, 1974. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any assignment or alienation made for the purposes of defraying plan administration costs. For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant's accrued non-forfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 of title 26 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1) of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &#8220;qualified domestic relations order&#8221; means a domestic relations order&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &#8220;domestic relations order&#8221; means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) each plan to which such order applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &#8220;earliest retirement age&#8221; means the earlier of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the date on which the participant is entitled to a distribution under the plan, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the later of the date of the participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the participant could begin receiving benefits under the plan if the participant separated from service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section 1055 of this title (and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if married for at least 1 year, the surviving former spouse shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1055(f) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Each plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedures&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall be in writing,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a domestic relations order as entitled to payment of benefits under the plan (at the address included in the domestic relations order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the domestic relations order, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate payee with respect to a domestic relations order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the &#8220;segregated amounts&#8221;) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period described in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(I) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) treating a domestic relations order as being (or not being) a qualified domestic relations order, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) taking action under subparagraph (H),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan's obligation to the participant and each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(J) A person who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order shall be considered for purposes of any provision of this chapter a beneficiary under the plan. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall permit a requirement under section 1301 of this title of the payment of more than 1 premium with respect to a participant for any period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(K) The term &#8220;alternate payee&#8221; means any spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(M) Payment of benefits by a pension plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of a qualified domestic relations order shall not be treated as garnishment for purposes of section 1673(a) of title 15.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(N) In prescribing regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any offset of a participant's benefits provided under an employee pension benefit plan against an amount that the participant is ordered or required to pay to the plan if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) under a judgment of conviction for a crime involving such plan,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) under a civil judgment (including a consent order or decree) entered by a court in an action brought in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Secretary and the participant, or a settlement agreement between the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the participant, in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle by a fiduciary or any other person,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the judgment, order, decree, or settlement agreement expressly provides for the offset of all or part of the amount ordered or required to be paid to the plan against the participant's benefits provided under the plan, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in a case in which the survivor annuity requirements of section 1055 of this title apply with respect to distributions from the plan to the participant, if the participant has a spouse at the time at which the offset is to be made&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) either&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) such spouse has consented in writing to such offset and such consent is witnessed by a notary public or representative of the plan (or it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that such consent may not be obtained by reason of circumstances described in section 1055(c)(2)(B) of this title), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 1055 of this title solely by reason of an offset under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The survivor annuity described in paragraph (4)(C)(iii) shall be determined as if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the participant terminated employment on the date of the offset,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there was no offset,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the plan permitted commencement of benefits only on or after normal retirement age,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &#8220;minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity&#8221; means the qualified joint and survivor annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the participant's accrued benefit (within the meaning of section 1002(23) of this title) and under which the survivor annuity is 50 percent of the amount of the annuity which is payable during the joint lives of the participant and the spouse.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on distributions other than life annuities paid by plan</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the fiduciary of a pension plan that is subject to the additional funding requirements of section 1082(d) of this title shall not permit a prohibited payment to be made from a plan during a period in which such plan has a liquidity shortfall (as defined in section 1082(e)(5) of this title).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1057 &#183; Temporary variances from certain vesting requirements</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any plan maintained on January 1, 1974, if not later than 2 years after September 2, 1974, the administrator petitions the Secretary, the Secretary may prescribe an alternate method which shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of section 1053(a)(2) or 1054(b)(1) (other than subparagraph (D) thereof) of this title or both for a period of not more than 4 years. The Secretary may prescribe such alternate method only when he finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the application of such requirements would increase the costs of the plan to such an extent that there would result a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan or a substantial curtailment of benefit levels or the levels of employees&#8217; compensation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the application of such requirements or discontinuance of the plan would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a waiver or extension of time granted under section 1083 or 1084 of this title would be inadequate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of any plan with respect to which an alternate method has been prescribed under the preceding provisions of this subsection for a period of not more than 4 years, if, not later than 1 year before the expiration of such period, the administrator petitions the Secretary for an extension of such alternate method, and the Secretary makes the findings required by the preceding sentence, such alternate method may be extended for not more than 3 years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A pension plan may not merge or consolidate with, or transfer its assets or liabilities to, any other plan after September 2, 1974, unless each participant in the plan would (if the plan then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the plan had then terminated). The preceding sentence shall not apply to any transaction to the extent that participants either before or after the transaction are covered under a multiemployer plan to which subchapter III of this chapter applies.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1059 &#183; Recordkeeping and reporting requirements</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided by paragraph (2) every employer shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, maintain records with respect to each of his employees sufficient to determine the benefits due or which may become due to such employees. The plan administrator shall make a report, in such manner and at such time as may be provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to each employee who is a participant under the plan and who&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requests such report, in such manner and at such time as may be provided in such regulations,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) terminates his service with the employer, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has a 1-year break in service (as defined in section 1053(b)(3)(A) of this title).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The employer shall furnish to the plan administrator the information necessary for the administrator to make the reports required by the preceding sentence. Not more than one report shall be required under subparagraph (A) in any 12-month period. Not more than one report shall be required under subparagraph (C) with respect to consecutive 1-year breaks in service. The report required under this paragraph shall be sufficient to inform the employee of his accrued benefits under the plan and the percentage of such benefits which are nonforfeitable under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If more than one employer adopts a plan, each such employer shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, furnish to the plan administrator the information necessary for the administrator to maintain the records and make the reports required by paragraph (1). Such administrator shall maintain the records and, to the extent provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, make the reports, required by paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) If any person who is required, under subsection (a) of this section, to furnish information or maintain records for any plan year fails to comply with such requirement, he shall pay to the Secretary a civil penalty of $10 for each employee with respect to whom such failure occurs, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Plan maintained by more than one employer</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or part 3, the following provisions of this subsection shall apply to a plan maintained by more than one employer:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 1052 of this title shall be applied as if all employees of each of the employers were employed by a single employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Sections 1053 and 1054 of this title shall be applied as if all such employers constituted a single employer, except that the application of any rules with respect to breaks in service shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The minimum funding standard provided by section 1082 of this title shall be determined as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Assumptions.&#8212;Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)(A)(i) of this section, the interest rate used under the plan shall be&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the case of a plan which, immediately before September 26, 1980, was a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 1002(37) of this title as in effect immediately before such date)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(iii), or (3)(B)(i) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a change in the definition of the term &#8220;wages&#8221; under section 3121 of title 26, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5) of title 26,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1083 &#183; Variance from minimum funding standard</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Waiver of requirements in event of business hardship</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If an employer, or in the case of a multi-employer plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) and if application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate, the Secretary of the Treasury may waive the requirements of section 1082(a) of this title for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard other than the portion thereof determined under section 1082(b)(2)(C) of this title. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years. The interest rate used for purposes of computing the amortization charge described in subsection (b)(2)(C) of this section for any plan year shall be&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, the greater of (A) 150 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of such plan year), or (B) the rate of interest used under the plan in determining costs (including adjustments under section 1082(b)(5)(B) of this title), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the rate determined under section 6621(b) of title 26.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Matters considered in determining business hardship</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the factors taken into account in determining temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) shall include (but shall not be limited to) whether&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the employer is operating at an economic loss,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &#8220;Waived funding deficiency&#8221; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &#8220;waived funding deficiency&#8221; means the portion of the minimum funding standard (determined without regard to subsection (b)(3)(C) of section 1082 of this title) for a plan year waived by the Secretary of the Treasury and not satisfied by employer contributions.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, if an employer is a member of a controlled group, the temporary substantial business hardship requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as met only if such requirements are met&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with respect to such employer, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to the controlled group of which such employer is a member (determined by treating all members of such group as a single employer).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if the Secretary of the Treasury determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Controlled group</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &#8220;controlled group&#8221; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of title 26.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice of filing of application for waiver</h4>

In the case of a multiemployer plan, such rate shall be the rate determined under section 6621(b) of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) No amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under section 1083(a) of this title or an extension of time under subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) of this title has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that the insurer manage those assets of the insurer which are assets of such insurer's general account (irrespective of whether any such assets are plan assets) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, taking into account all obligations supported by such enterprise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Compliance by the insurer with all requirements of the regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deemed compliance by such insurer with sections 1104, 1106, and 1107 of this title with respect to those assets of the insurer's general account which support a policy described in paragraph (3).</p>

Action under this subsection may be taken only after consultation and coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Secretary after consultation with Federal and State supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Schedules for premium rates and bases for application; establishment, coverage, etc.</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation shall prescribe such schedules of premium rates and bases for the application of those rates as may be necessary to provide sufficient revenue to the fund for the corporation to carry out its functions under this subchapter. The premium rates charged by the corporation for any period shall be uniform for all plans, other than multiemployer plans, insured by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title, and shall be uniform for all multiemployer plans with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the annual premium rate payable to the corporation by all plans for basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of a single-employer plan, for plan years beginning after December 31, 1990, an amount equal to the sum of $19 plus the additional premium (if any) determined under subparagraph (E) for each individual who is a participant in such plan during the plan year;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">is for any calendar year less than 2 times the amount of basic benefits guaranteed by the corporation under this subchapter for multiemployer plans which were paid out of any such fund or assets during the preceding calendar year, the annual premium rates under subparagraph (A) shall be increased to the next highest premium level necessary to insure that such sum will be at least 2 times greater than such amount during the following calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the board of directors of the corporation determines that an increase in the premium rates under subparagraph (A) is necessary to provide assistance to plans which are receiving assistance under section 1431 of this title and to plans the board finds are reasonably likely to require such assistance, the board may order such increase in the premium rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The maximum annual premium rate which may be established under this subparagraph is $2.60 for each participant.</p>

The notice shall invite public comment, and shall provide for a public hearing if one is requested. Any such hearing shall be commenced not later than 60 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The board of directors shall review the hearing record established under clause (i) and shall, not later than 30 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective, determine (after consideration of the comments received) whether the amount of the increase should be changed and shall publish its determination in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The additional premium determined under this subparagraph with respect to any plan for any plan year shall be an amount equal to the amount determined under clause (ii) divided by the number of participants in such plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amount determined under this clause for any plan year shall be an amount equal to $9.00 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of unfunded vested benefits under the plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For purposes of clause (ii)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) Except as provided in subclause (II) or (III), the term &#8220;unfunded vested benefits&#8221; means the amount which would be the unfunded current liability (within the meaning of section 1082(d)(8)(A) of this title) if only vested benefits were taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) The interest rate used in valuing vested benefits for purposes of subclause (I) shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the annual yield on 30-year Treasury securities for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins. For purposes of this subclause, the applicable percentage is 80 percent for plan years beginning before July 1, 1997, 85 percent for plan years beginning after June 30, 1997, and before the 1st plan year to which the first tables prescribed under section 1082(d)(7)(C)(ii)(II) of this title apply, and 100 percent for such 1st plan year and subsequent plan years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) In the case of any plan year for which the applicable percentage under subclause (II) is 100 percent, the value of the plan's assets used in determining unfunded current liability under subclause (I) shall be their fair market value.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) No premium shall be determined under this subparagraph for any plan year if, as of the close of the preceding plan year, contributions to the plan for the preceding plan year were not less than the full funding limitation for the preceding plan year under section 412(c)(7) of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may prescribe, subject to the enactment of a joint resolution in accordance with this section or section 1322a(f) of this title, alternative schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for basic benefits guaranteed by it under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title based, in whole or in part, on the risks insured by the corporation in each plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In carrying out its authority under paragraph (1) to establish schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for nonbasic benefits guaranteed under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title the premium rates charged by the corporation for any period for nonbasic benefits guaranteed shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) be uniform by category of nonbasic benefits guaranteed,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) be based on the risks insured in each category, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) reflect the experience of the corporation (including experience which may be reasonably anticipated) in guaranteeing such benefits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), premium rates charged to any multiemployer plan by the corporation for any period for supplemental guarantees under section 1322a(g)(2) of this title may reflect any reasonable considerations which the corporation determines to be appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans composed of the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a charge based on a rate applicable to the excess, if any, of the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed over the value of the assets of the plan, not in excess of 0.1 percent, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an additional charge based on a rate applicable to the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The rate for the additional charge referred to in clause (ii) shall be set by the corporation for every year at a level which the corporation estimates will yield total revenue approximately equal to the total revenue to be derived by the corporation from the charges referred to in clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans based on&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of participants in a plan, but such premium rates shall not exceed the rates described in paragraph (3),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) unfunded basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter, but such premium rates shall not exceed the limitations applicable to charges referred to in subparagraph (B)(i), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If the corporation uses two or more of the rate bases described in this subparagraph, the premium rates shall be designed to produce approximately equal amounts of aggregate premium revenue from each of the rate bases used.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the corporation shall by regulation define the terms &#8220;value of assets&#8221; and &#8220;present value of the benefits of the plan which are guaranteed&#8221; in a manner consistent with the purposes of this subchapter and the provisions of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Premiums payable when due; accrual; waiver or reduction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The designated payor of each plan shall pay the premiums imposed by the corporation under this subchapter with respect to that plan when they are due. Premiums under this subchapter are payable at the time, and on an estimated, advance, or other basis, as determined by the corporation. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on September 2, 1974 (applicable to that portion of any plan year during which such date occurs) are due within 30 days after such date. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on the first plan year commencing after September 2, 1974, are due within 30 days after such plan year commences. Premiums shall continue to accrue until a plan's assets are distributed pursuant to a termination procedure, or until a trustee is appointed pursuant to section 1342 of this title, whichever is earlier. The corporation may waive or reduce premiums for a multiemployer plan for any plan year during which such plan receives financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title, except that any amount so waived or reduced shall be treated as financial assistance under such section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Late payment charge; waiver</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If any basic benefit premium is not paid when it is due the corporation is authorized to assess a late payment charge of not more than 100 percent of the premium payment which was not timely paid. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any payment of premium made within 60 days after the date on which payment is due, if before such date, the designated payor obtains a waiver from the corporation based upon a showing of substantial hardship arising from the timely payment of the premium. The corporation is authorized to grant a waiver under this subsection upon application made by the designated payor, but the corporation may not grant a waiver if it appears that the designated payor will be unable to pay the premium within 60 days after the date on which it is due. If any premium is not paid by the last date prescribed for a payment, interest on the amount of such premium at the rate imposed under section 6601(a) of title 26 (relating to interest on underpayment, nonpayment, or extensions of time for payment of tax) shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Civil action to recover premium penalty and interest</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If any designated payor fails to pay a premium when due, the corporation is authorized to bring a civil action in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the plan assets are located, the plan is administered, or in which a defendant resides or is found for the recovery of the amount of the premium penalty, and interest, and process may be served in any other district. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over actions brought under this subsection by the corporation without regard to the amount in controversy.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basic benefits guarantee not stopped by designated payor's failure to pay premiums when due</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations contained in subsection (b) of this section, the corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a single-employer plan which terminates at a time when this subchapter applies to it.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>

For purposes of determining what benefits are guaranteed under this section in the case of a plan to which section 1321 of this title does not apply on September 3, 1974, the 60-month period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed beginning on the first date on which such section does apply to the plan.</p>

If a benefit payable by reason of disability is converted to an early or normal retirement benefit for reasons other than a change in the health of the participant, such early or normal retirement benefit shall be treated as a continuation of the benefit payable by reason of disability and this subparagraph shall continue to apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The actuarial value of a benefit, for purposes of this subsection, shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>

This paragraph does not apply to benefits payable under a plan unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) when such final distribution occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Methods of final distribution of assets</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1341a &#183; Termination of multiemployer plans</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Termination of a multiemployer plan under this section occurs as a result of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the adoption after September 26, 1980, of a plan amendment which provides that participants will receive no credit for any purpose under the plan for service with any employer after the date specified by such amendment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, within the meaning of section 1383 of this title, or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adoption of an amendment to the plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Date of termination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section is the later of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the amendment is adopted, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the amendment takes effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section is the earlier of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the last employer withdraws, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day of the first plan year for which no employer contributions were required under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duties of plan sponsor of amended plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) limit the payment of benefits to benefits which are nonforfeitable under the plan as of the date of the termination, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity, unless the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Duties of plan sponsor of nonoperative plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall reduce benefits and suspend benefit payments in accordance with section 1441 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of contribution of employer under amended plan for each plan year subsequent to plan termination date</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the rate of an employer's contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduction in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of benefits; reporting requirements for terminated plans and rules and standards for administration of such plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a terminated plan may authorize the payment other than in the form of an annuity of a participant's entire nonforfeitable benefit attributable to employer contributions, other than a death benefit, if the value of the entire nonforfeitable benefit does not exceed $1,750. The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation's risk of loss with respect to the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1342 &#183; Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under section 412 of title 26, or has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that a notice of deficiency under section 6212 of title 26 has been mailed with respect to the tax imposed under section 4971(a) of title 26,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the reportable event described in section 1343(c)(7) of this title has occurred, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c) of this section). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of trustee</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) of this section to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) of this section ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which section 1341a(d) of this title applies, unless such appointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjudication that plan must be terminated</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) of this section and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)&#160;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Powers of trustee</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section shall have the power&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to do any act authorized by the plan or this subchapter to be done by the plan administrator or any trustee of the plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to require the transfer of all (or any part) of the assets and records of the plan to himself as trustee;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to invest any assets of the plan which he holds in accordance with the provisions of the plan, regulations of the corporation, and applicable rules of law;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) to limit payment of benefits under the plan to basic benefits or to continue payment of some or all of the benefits which were being paid prior to his appointment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) in the case of a multiemployer plan, to reduce benefits or suspend benefit payments under the plan, give appropriate notices, amend the plan, and perform other acts required or authorized by subtitle (E) of this subchapter to be performed by the plan sponsor or administrator;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) to do such other acts as he deems necessary to continue operation of the plan without increasing the potential liability of the corporation, if such acts may be done under the provisions of the plan; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) to require the plan sponsor, the plan administrator, any contributing or withdrawn employer, and any employee organization representing plan participants to furnish any information with respect to the plan which the trustee may reasonably need in order to administer the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If the court to which application is made under subsection (c) of this section dismisses the application with prejudice, or if the corporation fails to apply for a decree under subsection (c) of this section, within 30 days after the date on which the trustee is appointed under subsection (b) of this section, the trustee shall transfer all assets and records of the plan held by him to the plan administrator within 3 business days after such dismissal or the expiration of such 30-day period, and shall not be liable to the plan or any other person for his acts as trustee except for willful misconduct, or for conduct in violation of the provisions of part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter (except as provided in subsection (d)(1)(A)(v) of this section). The 30-day period referred to in this subparagraph may be extended as provided by agreement between the plan administrator and the corporation or by court order obtained by the corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the court to which an application is made under subsection (c) of this section issues the decree requested in such application, in addition to the powers described in subparagraph (A), the trustee shall have the power&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to pay benefits under the plan in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to collect for the plan any amounts due the plan, including but not limited to the power to collect from the persons obligated to meet the requirements of section 1082 of this title or the terms of the plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to receive any payment made by the corporation to the plan under this subchapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) to commence, prosecute, or defend on behalf of the plan any suit or proceeding involving the plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) to issue, publish, or file such notices, statements, and reports as may be required by the corporation or any order of the court;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) to liquidate the plan assets;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) to recover payments under section 1345(a) of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) to do such other acts as may be necessary to comply with this subchapter or any order of the court and to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable after his appointment, the trustee shall give notice to interested parties of the institution of proceedings under this subchapter to determine whether the plan should be terminated or to terminate the plan, whichever is applicable. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &#8220;interested party&#8221; means&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan administrator,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) each participant in the plan and each beneficiary of a deceased participant,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, or as may be otherwise ordered by the court, a trustee appointed under this section shall be subject to the same duties as those of a trustee under section 704 of title 11, and shall be, with respect to the plan, a fiduciary within the meaning of paragraph (21) of section 1002 of this title and under section 4975(e) of title 26 (except to the extent that the provisions of this subchapter are inconsistent with the requirements applicable under part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter and of such section 4975).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exclusive jurisdiction; stay of other proceedings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of an application for the appointment of a trustee or the issuance of a decree under this section, the court to which an application is made shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the plan involved and its property wherever located with the powers, to the extent consistent with the purposes of this section, of a court of the United States having jurisdiction over cases under chapter 11 of title 11. Pending an adjudication under subsection (c) of this section such court shall stay, and upon appointment by it of a trustee, as provided in this section such court shall continue the stay of, any pending mortgage foreclosure, equity receivership, or other proceeding to reorganize, conserve, or liquidate the plan or its property and any other suit against any receiver, conservator, or trustee of the plan or its property.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of title 26 then, if required to prevent the disqualification of the plan (or any trust under the plan) under section 401(a) or 403(a) of title 26, the assets allocated under subsections (a)(4)(B), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such discrimination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in section 1058 of this title occurs, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of any assets transferred in such transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the present value of all portions of the accrued benefits with respect to participants which are derived from participants&#8217; mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the present value of all benefits with respect to which assets are allocated under paragraphs (2) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require the plan fund to be equitable allocated between those participants no longer working in covered service under the plan as a result of the withdrawal, and those participants who remain in covered service under the plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &#8220;seller&#8221;) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &#8220;purchaser&#8221;), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the purchaser&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>

Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the variance or exemption,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of overburden status of plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Individuals trained under any program satisfying the requirements of this section may be included by the private industry council in its performance accomplishments and the wage gains of such individuals shall be included in determining the compliance of the job training program of the private industry council with applicable standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Department of Labor, shall promulgate regulations setting forth how the Office will determine, during a compliance review, the degree to which a training program will satisfy the contractor's affirmative action obligations. The training and placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor may be considered in evaluating such contractor's overall good faith efforts, but in no event may placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor be permitted to affect that contractor's affirmative action obligations respecting its work force.

Successful performance or operation of a training program meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall create a presumption that the contractor has made a good faith effort to meet its affirmative action obligations to the degree specified by the Director under paragraph (2) of this subsection, but that presumption shall not be applicable to the satisfaction of other affirmative action obligations not directly related to the training and hiring requirements of this section, or other affirmative action obligations not affected by this section. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, &#8220;successful performance or operation&#8221; means training and placing in jobs a number of individuals which bears a reasonable relationship to the number of job openings in the contractors's&#160;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2102 &#183; Notice required before plant closings and mass layoffs</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to employees, State dislocated worker units, and local governments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">An employer shall not order a plant closing or mass layoff until the end of a 60-day period after the employer serves written notice of such an order&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to each representative of the affected employees as of the time of the notice or, if there is no such representative at that time, to each affected employee; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If there is more than one such unit, the unit of local government which the employer shall notify is the unit of local government to which the employer pays the highest taxes for the year preceding the year for which the determination is made.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reduction of notification period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) An employer may order the shutdown of a single site of employment before the conclusion of the 60-day period if as of the time that notice would have been required the employer was actively seeking capital or business which, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown and the employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An employer may order a plant closing or mass layoff before the conclusion of the 60-day period if the closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) No notice under this chapter shall be required if the plant closing or mass layoff is due to any form of natural disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, or the drought currently ravaging the farmlands of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) An employer relying on this subsection shall give as much notice as is practicable and at that time shall give a brief statement of the basis for reducing the notification period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of layoff period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A layoff of more than 6 months which, at its outset, was announced to be a layoff of 6 months or less, shall be treated as an employment loss under this chapter unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the extension beyond 6 months is caused by business circumstances (including unforeseeable changes in price or cost) not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension beyond 6 months will be required.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determinations with respect to employment loss</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, in determining whether a plant closing or mass layoff has occurred or will occur, employment losses for 2 or more groups at a single site of employment, each of which is less than the minimum number of employees specified in section 2101(a)(2) or (3) of this title but which in the aggregate exceed that minimum number, and which occur within any 90-day period shall be considered to be a plant closing or mass layoff unless the employer demonstrates that the employment losses are the result of separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by the employer to evade the requirements of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This chapter shall not apply to a plant closing or mass layoff if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the closing is of a temporary facility or the closing or layoff is the result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the closing or layoff constitutes a strike or constitutes a lockout not intended to evade the requirements of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall require an employer to serve written notice pursuant to section 2102(a) of this title when permanently replacing a person who is deemed to be an economic striker under the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.]: Provided, That nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to validate or invalidate any judicial or administrative ruling relating to the hiring of permanent replacements for economic strikers under the National Labor Relations Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount for which an employer is liable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any wages paid by the employer to the employee for the period of the violation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any voluntary and unconditional payment by the employer to the employee that is not required by any legal obligation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any payment by the employer to a third party or trustee (such as premiums for health benefits or payments to a defined contribution pension plan) on behalf of and attributable to the employee for the period of the violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition, any liability incurred under paragraph (1) with respect to a defined benefit pension plan may be reduced by crediting the employee with service for all purposes under such a plan for the period of the violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an employer which has violated this chapter proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission that violated this chapter was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of this chapter the court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of the liability or penalty provided for in this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A person seeking to enforce such liability, including a representative of employees or a unit of local government aggrieved under paragraph (1) or (3), may sue either for such person or for other persons similarly situated, or both, in any district court of the United States for any district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, or in which the employer transacts business.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any such suit, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.</p>

<h3 class="chapter-head">Chapter 24. Technology Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2201 &#183; Findings, purposes, and policy</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) live independently;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enjoy self-determination;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) make choices;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) pursue meaningful careers; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) During the past decade, there have been major advances in modern technology. Technology is now a powerful force in the lives of all residents of the United States. Technology can provide important tools for making the performance of tasks quicker and easier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For some individuals with disabilities, assistive technology devices and assistive technology services are necessary to enable the individuals&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to have greater control over their lives;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to participate in, and contribute more fully to, activities in their home, school, and work environments, and in their communities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to interact to a greater extent with individuals who do not have disabilities; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to otherwise benefit from opportunities that are taken for granted by individuals who do not have disabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Substantial progress has been made in the development of assistive technology devices, including adaptations to existing equipment, that significantly benefit individuals with disabilities of all ages. Such devices can be used to increase the involvement of such individuals in, and reduce expenditures associated with, programs and activities such as early intervention, education, rehabilitation and training, employment, residential living, independent living, recreation, and other aspects of daily living.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Most States have technology-related assistance programs carried out under this chapter. In spite of the efforts made by such programs, there remains a need to support systems change and advocacy activities in order to assist States to develop and implement consumer-responsive, comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related assistance for individuals with disabilities of all ages.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Notwithstanding the efforts of such State technology-related assistance programs, there is still a lack of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) resources to pay for assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) trained personnel to assist individuals with disabilities to use such devices and services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) information among individuals with disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, individuals who work for public agencies, or for private entities (including insurers), that have contact with individuals with disabilities, educators and related service personnel, technology experts (including engineers), employers, and other appropriate individuals about the availability and potential of technology for individuals with disabilities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) aggressive outreach to underrepresented populations and rural populations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) systems that ensure timely acquisition and delivery of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, particularly with respect to children;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) coordination among State human services programs, and between such programs and private entities, particularly with respect to transitions between such programs and entities; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) capacity in such programs to provide the necessary technology-related assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Many individuals with disabilities cannot access existing telecommunications and information technologies and are at risk of not being able to access developing technologies. The failure of Federal and State governments, hardware manufacturers, software designers, information systems managers, and telecommunications service providers to account for the specific needs of individuals with disabilities results in the exclusion of such individuals from the use of telecommunications and information technologies and results in unnecessary costs associated with the retrofitting of devices and product systems.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) There are insufficient incentives for the commercial pursuit of the application of technology devices to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, because of the perception that such individuals constitute a limited market.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) At the Federal level, there is a lack of coordination among agencies that provide or pay for the provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services. In addition, the Federal Government does not provide adequate assistance and information with respect to the use of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services to individuals with disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, individuals who work for public agencies, or for private entities (including insurers), that have contact with individuals with disabilities, educators and related services personnel, technology experts (including engineers), employers, and other appropriate individuals.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To provide financial assistance to the States to support systems change and advocacy activities designed to assist each State in developing and implementing a consumer-responsive comprehensive statewide program of technology-related assistance, for individuals with disabilities of all ages, that is designed to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increase the availability of, funding for, access to, and provision of, assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase the active involvement of individuals with disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of such a program;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Federal, State, and local programs addressing the training and employment needs of displaced homemakers have been fragmented and insufficient to serve displaced homemakers effectively.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2601 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of single-parent households and two-parent households in which the single parent or both parents work is increasing significantly;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is important for the development of children and the family unit that fathers and mothers be able to participate in early childrearing and the care of family members who have serious health conditions;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) employment standards that apply to one gender only have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this Act&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons (including maternity-related disability) and for compelling family reasons, on a gender-neutral basis; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men, pursuant to such clause.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2701 &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In an increasingly competitive world economy, the companies and nations that lead in the rapid development, commercialization, and application of new and advanced technologies, and in the high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services, will lead in economic growth, employment, and high living standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) While the United States remains the world leader in science and invention, it has not done well in rapidly making the transition from achievement in its research laboratories to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services. This lag and the unprecedented competitive challenge that the United States has faced from abroad have contributed to a drop in real wages and living standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Companies that are successfully competitive in the rapid development, commercialization, application, and implementation of advanced technologies, and in the successful delivery of goods and services, recognize that worker participation and labor-management cooperation in the deployment, application, and implementation of advanced workplace technologies make an important contribution to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services and in maintaining and improving real wages for workers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Federal Government has an important role in encouraging and augmenting private sector efforts relating to the development, application, manufacture, and deployment of new and advanced technologies. The role should be to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) work with private companies, States, worker organizations, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education to ensure the development, application, production, and implementation of new and advanced technologies to promote the improvement of workers&#8217; skills, wages, job security, and working conditions, and a healthy environment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) encourage worker and worker organization participation in the development, commercialization, evaluation, selection, application, and implementation of new and advanced technologies in the workplace; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promote the use and integration of new and advanced technologies in the workplace that enhance workers&#8217; skills.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In working with the private sector to promote the technological leadership and economic growth of the United States, the Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that Federal technology programs help the United States to remain competitive and to maintain and improve living standards and to create and retain secure jobs in economically stable communities.</p>
