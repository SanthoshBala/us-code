<p class="statutory-body">(a) Definitions.&#8212;In this section:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Contract.&#8212;The term &#8220;contract&#8221; means any actual or proposed contract, agreement, understanding, or other arrangement, and includes any assignment, substitution of parties, or subcontract executed or entered into thereunder.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Made.&#8212;The term &#8220;made&#8221;, when used in relation to any invention, means the conception or first actual reduction to practice of such invention.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Person.&#8212;The term &#8220;person&#8221; means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, institution, or other entity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Exclusive Property of United States.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;An invention shall be the exclusive property of the United States if it is made in the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration, and the Administrator determines that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the person who made the invention was employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work and the invention is related to the work the person was employed or assigned to perform, or was within the scope of the person's employment duties, whether or not it was made during working hours, or with a contribution by the Government of the use of Government facilities, equipment, materials, allocated funds, information proprietary to the Government, or services of Government employees during working hours; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the person who made the invention was not employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work, but the invention is nevertheless related to the contract, or to the work or duties the person was employed or assigned to perform, and was made during working hours, or with a contribution from the Government of the sort referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Patent to united states.&#8212;If an invention is the exclusive property of the United States under paragraph (1), and if such invention is patentable, a patent therefor shall be issued to the United States upon application made by the Administrator, unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States to such invention in conformity with the provisions of subsection (g).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Contract Provisions for Furnishing Reports of Inventions, Discoveries, Improvements, or Innovations.&#8212;Each contract entered into by the Administrator with any party for the performance of any work shall contain effective provisions under which the party shall furnish promptly to the Administrator a written report containing full and complete technical information concerning any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation which may be made in the performance of any such work.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Patent Application.&#8212;No patent may be issued to any applicant other than the Administrator for any invention which appears to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (hereafter in this section referred to as the &#8220;Director&#8221;) to have significant utility in the conduct of aeronautical and space activities unless the applicant files with the Director, with the application or within 30 days after request therefor by the Director, a written statement executed under oath setting forth the full facts concerning the circumstances under which the invention was made and stating the relationship (if any) of the invention to the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration. Copies of each such statement and the application to which it relates shall be transmitted forthwith by the Director to the Administrator.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Issuance of Patent to Applicant.&#8212;Upon any application as to which any such statement has been transmitted to the Administrator, the Director may, if the invention is patentable, issue a patent to the applicant unless the Administrator, within 90 days after receipt of the application and statement, requests that the patent be issued to the Administrator on behalf of the United States. If, within such time, the Administrator files such a request with the Director, the Director shall transmit notice thereof to the applicant, and shall issue such patent to the Administrator unless the applicant within 30 days after receipt of the notice requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether the Administrator is entitled under this section to receive the patent. The Board may hear and determine, in accordance with rules and procedures established for interference cases, the question so presented, and its determination shall be subject to appeal by the applicant or by the Administrator to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with procedures governing appeals from decisions of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in other proceedings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Subsequent Transfer of Patent in Case of False Representations.&#8212;Whenever a patent has been issued to an applicant in conformity with subsection (e), and the Administrator thereafter has reason to believe that the statement filed by the applicant in connection with the patent contained a false representation of a material fact, the Administrator, within 5 years after the date of issuance of the patent, may file with the Director a request for the transfer to the Administrator of title to the patent on the records of the Director. Notice of any such request shall be transmitted by the Director to the owner of record of the patent, and title to the patent shall be so transferred to the Administrator unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice, the owner of record requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether any such false representation was contained in the statement filed in connection with the patent. The question shall be heard and determined, and the determination shall be subject to review, in the manner prescribed by subsection (e) for questions arising thereunder. A request made by the Administrator under this subsection for the transfer of title to a patent, and prosecution for the violation of any criminal statute, shall not be barred by the failure of the Administrator to make a request under subsection (e) for the issuance of the patent to the Administrator, or by any notice previously given by the Administrator stating that the Administrator had no objection to the issuance of the patent to the applicant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Waiver of Rights to Inventions.&#8212;Under such regulations in conformity with this subsection as the Administrator shall prescribe, the Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States under this section with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or which may be made by any person or class of persons in the performance of any work required by any contract of the Administration if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served thereby. Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the interests of the United States. Each such waiver made with respect to any invention shall be subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the United States. Each proposal for any waiver under this subsection shall be referred to an Inventions and Contributions Board which shall be established by the Administrator within the Administration. Such Board shall accord to each interested party an opportunity for hearing, and shall transmit to the Administrator its findings of fact with respect to such proposal and its recommendations for action to be taken with respect thereto.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Protection of Title.&#8212;The Administrator is authorized to take all suitable and necessary steps to protect any invention or discovery to which the Administrator has title, and to require contractors or persons who retain title to inventions or discoveries under this section to protect the inventions or discoveries to which the Administration has or may acquire a license of use.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Administration as Defense Agency.&#8212;The Administration shall be considered a defense agency of the United States for the purpose of chapter 17 of title 35.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) Objects Intended for Launch, Launched, or Assembled in Outer Space.&#8212;Any object intended for launch, launched, or assembled in outer space shall be considered a vehicle for the purpose of section 272 of title 35.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k) Use or Manufacture of Patented Inventions Incorporated in Space Vehicles Launched for Persons Other Than United States.&#8212;The use or manufacture of any patented invention incorporated in a space vehicle launched by the United States Government for a person other than the United States shall not be considered to be a use or manufacture by or for the United States within the meaning of section 1498(a) of title 28, unless the Administration gives an express authorization or consent for such use or manufacture.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;50901 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Findings.&#8212;Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the peaceful uses of outer space continue to be of great value and to offer benefits to all mankind;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private applications of space technology have achieved a significant level of commercial and economic activity and offer the potential for growth in the future, particularly in the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) new and innovative equipment and services are being sought, produced, and offered by entrepreneurs in telecommunications, information services, microgravity research, human space flight, and remote sensing technologies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the private sector in the United States has the capability of developing and providing private launching, reentry, and associated services that would complement the launching, reentry, and associated capabilities of the United States Government;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the development of commercial launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services would enable the United States to retain its competitive position internationally, contributing to the national interest and economic well-being of the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) providing launch services and reentry services by the private sector is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and would be facilitated by stable, minimal, and appropriate regulatory guidelines that are fairly and expeditiously applied;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the United States should encourage private sector launches, reentries, and associated services and, only to the extent necessary, regulate those launches, reentries, and services to ensure compliance with international obligations of the United States and to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) space transportation, including the establishment and operation of launch sites, reentry sites, and complementary facilities, the providing of launch services and reentry services, the establishment of support facilities, and the providing of support services, is an important element of the transportation system of the United States, and in connection with the commerce of the United States there is a need to develop a strong space transportation infrastructure with significant private sector involvement;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the participation of State governments in encouraging and facilitating private sector involvement in space-related activity, particularly through the establishment of a space transportation-related infrastructure, including launch sites, reentry sites, complementary facilities, and launch site and reentry site support facilities, is in the national interest and is of significant public benefit;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the goal of safely opening space to the American people and their private commercial, scientific, and cultural enterprises should guide Federal space investments, policies, and regulations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) private industry has begun to develop commercial launch vehicles capable of carrying human beings into space and greater private investment in these efforts will stimulate the Nation's commercial space transportation industry as a whole;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) space transportation is inherently risky, and the future of the commercial human space flight industry will depend on its ability to continually improve its safety performance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) a critical area of responsibility for the Department of Transportation is to regulate the operations and safety of the emerging commercial human space flight industry;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the public interest is served by creating a clear legal, regulatory, and safety regime for commercial human space flight; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) the regulatory standards governing human space flight must evolve as the industry matures so that regulations neither stifle technology development nor expose crew or space flight participants to avoidable risks as the public comes to expect greater safety for crew and space flight participants from the industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Purposes.&#8212;The purposes of this chapter are&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to promote economic growth and entrepreneurial activity through use of the space environment for peaceful purposes;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the United States private sector to provide launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) simplifying and expediting the issuance and transfer of commercial licenses;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) facilitating and encouraging the use of Government-developed space technology; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promoting the continuous improvement of the safety of launch vehicles designed to carry humans, including through the issuance of regulations, to the extent permitted by this chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide that the Secretary of Transportation is to oversee and coordinate the conduct of commercial launch and reentry operations, issue permits and commercial licenses and transfer commercial licenses authorizing those operations, and protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to facilitate the strengthening and expansion of the United States space transportation infrastructure, including the enhancement of United States launch sites and launch-site support facilities, and development of reentry sites, with Government, State, and private sector involvement, to support the full range of United States space-related activities.</p>

However, claims may be paid under this section only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to one launch or reentry&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not provide for paying a part of a claim for which death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss results from willful misconduct by the licensee or transferee. To the extent insurance required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title is not available to cover a successful third party liability claim because of an insurance policy exclusion the Secretary decides is usual for the type of insurance involved, the Secretary may provide for paying the excluded claims without regard to the limitation contained in section 50914(a)(1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notice, Participation, and Approval.&#8212;Before a payment under subsection (a) of this section is made&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Withholding Payments.&#8212;The Secretary may withhold a payment under subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary certifies that the amount is not reasonable. However, the Secretary shall deem to be reasonable the amount of a claim finally decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Surveys, Reports, and Compensation Plans.&#8212;(1) If as a result of an activity carried out under a license issued or transferred under this chapter the total of claims related to one launch or reentry is likely to be more than the amount of required insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the Secretary shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) survey the causes and extent of damage; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) submit expeditiously to Congress a report on the results of the survey.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after a court determination indicates that the liability for the total of claims related to one launch or reentry may be more than the required amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary, shall submit to Congress a compensation plan that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) outlines the total dollar value of the claims;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recommends sources of amounts to pay for the claims;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be submitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives on the same day and when the Senate and House are in session.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Congressional Resolutions.&#8212;(1) In this subsection, &#8220;resolution&#8221;&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) means a joint resolution of Congress the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &#8220;That the Congress approves the compensation plan numbered __________ submitted to the Congress on __________ XX, 20____.&#8221;, with the blank spaces being filled appropriately; but</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not include a resolution that includes more than one compensation plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Senate shall consider under this subsection a compensation plan requiring additional appropriations or legislative authority not later than 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is submitted to Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred immediately to a committee by the President of the Senate. All resolutions related to the same plan shall be referred to the same committee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the committee of the Senate to which a resolution has been referred does not report the resolution within 20 calendar days after it is referred, a motion is in order to discharge the committee from further consideration of the resolution or to discharge the committee from further consideration of the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) After a committee of the Senate reports, or is discharged from further consideration of, a resolution, a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is in order at any time, even though a similar previous motion has been disagreed to. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Debate on the resolution referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is limited to not more than 10 hours, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) The following shall be decided in the Senate without debate:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a motion to postpone consideration of a resolution.</p>
