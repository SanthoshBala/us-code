<h3 class="section-head">&#167;466 &#183; Sense of Congress reaffirming the continued importance and applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly known as the &#8220;Posse Comitatus Act&#8221;) prohibits the use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in enforcing Federal law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title 10 (commonly known as the &#8220;Insurrection Act&#8221;), and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress reaffirms the continued importance of section 1385 of title 18, and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this chapter should be construed to alter the applicability of such section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws.</p>

<h3 class="part-head">Part I&#8212;Information Sharing</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;481 &#183; Short title; findings; and sense of Congress</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">This part may be cited as the &#8220;Homeland Security Information Sharing Act&#8221;.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist attack.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal Government relies on State and local personnel to protect against terrorist attack.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and protects classified and sensitive but unclassified information to enhance homeland security.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Some homeland security information is needed by the State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for terrorist attack.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected status of such information and to protect the sources and methods used to acquire such information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and local levels of government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt classified information so it may be shared with State and local personnel without the need for granting additional security clearances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) State and local personnel have capabilities and opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Federal Government and State and local governments and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Federal, State, and local governments and intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Information systems, including the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified information among Federal, State, and local entities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Increased efforts to share homeland security information should avoid duplicating existing information systems.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sense of Congress</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland security information to the maximum extent practicable, with special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural communities.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 107&#8211;296, title VIII, &#167;891, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2252.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;482 &#183; Facilitating homeland security information sharing procedures</h3>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to the extent such information is in classified form, determine whether, how, and to what extent to remove classified information, as appropriate, and with which such personnel it may be shared after such information is removed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall ensure that such procedures apply to all agencies of the Federal Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such procedures shall not change the substantive requirements for the classification and safeguarding of classified information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Such procedures shall not change the requirements and authorities to protect sources and methods.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures for sharing of homeland security information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each information sharing system through which information is shared under paragraph (1) shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be accessible to appropriate State and local personnel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall establish conditions on the use of information shared under paragraph (1)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to protect the constitutional and statutory rights of any individuals who are subjects of such information; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to provide data integrity through the timely removal and destruction of obsolete or erroneous names and information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the information sharing system through which information is shared under such paragraph include existing information sharing systems, including, but not limited to, the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, the Regional Information Sharing System, and the Terrorist Threat Warning System of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each appropriate Federal agency, as determined by the President, shall have access to each information sharing system through which information is shared under paragraph (1), and shall therefore have access to all information, as appropriate, shared under such paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall ensure that appropriate State and local personnel are authorized to use such information sharing systems&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to access information shared with such personnel; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to share, with others who have access to such information sharing systems, the homeland security information of their own jurisdictions, which shall be marked appropriately as pertaining to potential terrorist activity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Under procedures prescribed jointly by the Director of Central Intelligence and the Attorney General, each appropriate Federal agency, as determined by the President, shall review and assess the information shared under paragraph (6) and integrate such information with existing intelligence.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sharing of classified information and sensitive but unclassified information with State and local personnel</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President shall prescribe procedures under which Federal agencies may, to the extent the President considers necessary, share with appropriate State and local personnel homeland security information that remains classified or otherwise protected after the determinations prescribed under the procedures set forth in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is the sense of Congress that such procedures may include 1 or more of the following means:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Carrying out security clearance investigations with respect to appropriate State and local personnel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) With respect to information that is sensitive but unclassified, entering into nondisclosure agreements with appropriate State and local personnel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Increased use of information-sharing partnerships that include appropriate State and local personnel, such as the Joint Terrorism Task Forces of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Anti-Terrorism Task Forces of the Department of Justice, and regional Terrorism Early Warning Groups.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Responsible officials</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For each affected Federal agency, the head of such agency shall designate an official to administer this chapter with respect to such agency.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal control of information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Under procedures prescribed under this section, information obtained by a State or local government from a Federal agency under this section shall remain under the control of the Federal agency, and a State or local law authorizing or requiring such a government to disclose information shall not apply to such information.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
