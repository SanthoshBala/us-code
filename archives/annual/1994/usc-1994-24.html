       <p class="statutory-body">
        In all cases of unperfected bona fide claims lying within the said boundaries of said reserve, which claims have been properly initiated prior to September 2, 1902, said claims may be perfected upon compliance with the requirements of the laws respecting settlement, residence, improvements, and so forth, in the same manner in all respects as claims are perfected to other Government lands:
        <em>
         Provided,
        </em>
        That to the extent that the lands within said reserve are held in private ownership the Secretary of the Interior is authorized in his discretion to exchange therefor public lands of like area and value, which are surveyed, vacant, unappropriated, not mineral, not timbered, and not required for reservoir sites or other public uses or purposes. The private owners must, at their expense and by appropriate instruments of conveyance, surrender to the Government a full and unencumbered right and title to the private lands included in any exchange before patents are issued for or any rights attached to the public lands included therein, and no charge of any kind shall be made for issuing such patents. Upon completion of any exchange the land surrendered to the Government shall become a part of said reserve in a like manner as if they had been public lands at the time of the establishment of said reserve. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize the issuance of any land scrip, and the State of South Dakota is granted the privilege of selecting from the public lands in said State an equal quantity of land in lieu of such portions of section sixteen included within said reserve as have not been sold or disposed of by said State and are not covered by an unperfected bona fide claim as above mentioned.

       <p class="statutory-body">
        (a) The Congress makes the following findings:
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (1) Governmentally administered mental health services in the District of Columbia are currently provided through two separate public entities, the federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital and the Mental Health Services Administration of the District of Columbia Department of Human Resources.
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (2) The District of Columbia has a continuing responsibility to provide mental health services to its residents.
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (3) The Federal Government, through its operation of a national mental health program at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, has for over 100 years assisted the District of Columbia in carrying out that responsibility.
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (4) Since its establishment by Congress in 1855, Saint Elizabeths Hospital has developed into a respected national mental health hospital and study, training, and treatment center, providing a range of quality mental health and related services, including—
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (i) acute and chronic inpatient psychiatric care;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (ii) outpatient psychiatric and substance abuse clinical and related services;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (iii) Federal court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient treatment services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or post-sentence psychiatric evaluation;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (iv) patient care and related services for designated classes of individuals entitled to mental health benefits under Federal law, such as certain members and employees of the United States Armed Forces and the Foreign Service, and residents of American overseas dependencies;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (v) District of Columbia court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient treatment services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or postsentence psychiatric evaluation;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (vi) programs for special populations such as the mentally ill deaf;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (vii) support for basic and applied clinical psychiatric research and related patient services conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and other institutions; and
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (viii) professional and paraprofessional training in the major mental health disciplines.
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (5) The continuation of the range of services currently provided by federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital must be assured, as these services are integrally related to—
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (i) the availability of adequate mental health services to District of Columbia residents, nonresidents who require mental health services while in the District of Columbia, individuals entitled to mental health services under Federal law, and individuals referred by both Federal and local court systems; and
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (ii) the Nation's capacity to increase our knowledge and understanding about mental illness and to facilitate and continue the development and broad availability of sound and modern methods and approaches for the treatment of mental illness.
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (6) The assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital from the Federal Government by the District of Columbia, and the integration of those functions, resources, and programs into a comprehensive mental health care system administered solely by the District of Columbia, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the services currently provided through those two separate entities by shifting the primary focus of care to an integrated community-based system.
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (7) Such assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital by the District of Columbia would further the principle of home rule for the District of Columbia.
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body">
        (b) It is the intent of Congress that—
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (1) the District of Columbia have in operation no later than October 1, 1993, an integrated coordinated mental health system in the District which provides—

        (A) high quality, cost-effective, and community-based programs and facilities;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (B) a continuum of inpatient and outpatient mental health care, residential treatment, and support services through an appropriate balance of public and private resources; and
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-2em">
        (C) assurances that patient rights and medical needs are protected;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (2) the comprehensive District mental health care system be in full compliance with the Federal court consent decree in Dixon v. Heckler;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (3) the District and Federal Governments bear equitable shares of the costs of a transition from the present system to a comprehensive District mental health system;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (4) the transition to a comprehensive District mental health system provided for by this subchapter be carried out with maximum consideration for the interests of employees of the Hospital and provide a right-of-first-re
        fusal to such employees for employment at comparable levels in positions created under the system implementation plan;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (5) the Federal Government have the responsibility for the retraining of Hospital employees to prepare such employees for the requirements of employment in a comprehensive District mental health system;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (6) the Federal Government continue high quality mental health research, training, and demonstration programs at Saint Elizabeths Hospital;
       </p>
       <p class="statutory-body-1em">
        (7) the District government establish and maintain accreditation and licensing standards for all services provided in District mental health facilities which assure quality care consistent with appropriate Federal regulations and comparable with standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals; and
