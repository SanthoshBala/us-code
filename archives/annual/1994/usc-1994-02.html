<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any civil action for relief instituted by the Commission under subparagraph (A), if the court determines that the Commission has established that the person involved in such civil action has committed a knowing and willful violation of this Act or of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, the court may impose a civil penalty which does not exceed the greater of $10,000 or an amount equal to 200 percent of any contribution or expenditure involved in such violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any proceeding under this paragraph the court may declare that the dismissal of the complaint or the failure to act is contrary to law, and may direct the Commission to conform with such declaration within 30 days, failing which the complainant may bring, in the name of such complainant, a civil action to remedy the violation involved in the original complaint.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(9) Any judgment of a district court under this subsection may be appealed to the court of appeals, and the judgment of the court of appeals affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the district court shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Extraneous provisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a provision of a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution considered pursuant to section 641 of this title shall be considered extraneous if such provision does not produce a change in outlays or revenues, including changes in outlays and revenues brought about by changes in the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues are required to be collected (but a provision in which outlay decreases or revenue increases exactly offset outlay increases or revenue decreases shall not be considered extraneous by virtue of this subparagraph); (B) any provision producing an increase in outlays or decrease in revenues shall be considered extraneous if the net effect of provisions reported by the committee reporting the title containing the provision is that the committee fails to achieve its reconciliation instructions; (C) a provision that is not in the jurisdiction of the committee with jurisdiction over said title or provision shall be considered extraneous; (D) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it produces changes in outlays or revenues which are merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision; (E) a provision shall be considered to be extraneous if it increases, or would increase, net outlays, or if it decreases, or would decrease, revenues during a fiscal year after the fiscal years covered by such reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution, and such increases or decreases are greater than outlay reductions or revenue increases resulting from other provisions in such title in such year; and (F) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it violates section 641(g) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A Senate-originated provision shall not be considered extraneous under paragraph (1)(A) if the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on the Budget and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee which reported the provision certify that: (A) the provision mitigates direct effects clearly attributable to a provision changing outlays or revenues and both provisions together produce a net reduction in the deficit; (B) the provision will result in a substantial reduction in outlays or a substantial increase in revenues during fiscal years after the fiscal years covered by the reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution; (C) a reduction of outlays or an increase in revenues is likely to occur as a result of the provision, in the event of new regulations authorized by the provision or likely to be proposed, court rulings on pending litigation, or relationships between economic indices and stipulated statutory triggers pertaining to the provision, other than the regulations, court rulings or relationships currently projected by the Congressional Budget Office for scorekeeping purposes; or (D) such provision will be likely to produce a significant reduction in outlays or increase in revenues but, due to insufficient data, such reduction or increase cannot be reliably estimated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A provision reported by a committee shall not be considered extraneous under paragraph (1)(C) if (A) the provision is an integral part of a provision or title, which if introduced as a bill or resolution would be referred to such committee, and the provision sets forth the procedure to carry out or implement the substantive provisions that were reported and which fall within the jurisdiction of such committee; or (B) the provision states an exception to, or a special application of, the general provision or title of which it is a part and such general provision or title if introduced as a bill or resolution would be referred to such committee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such point of order being sustained,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">such material contained in such conference report or amendment shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed, without intervening action or motion, to consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or concur in the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case may be, which further amendment shall consist of only that portion of the conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate shall be debatable for two hours. In any case in which such point of order is sustained against a conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by operation of this subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the reporting or discharge of a reconciliation bill or resolution pursuant to section 641 of this title in the Senate, and again upon the submission of a conference report on such a reconciliation bill or resolution, the Committee on the Budget of the Senate shall submit for the record a list of material considered to be extraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of this section to the instructions of a committee as provided in this section. The inclusion or exclusion of a provision shall not constitute a determination of extraneousness by the Presiding Officer of the Senate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) General point of order</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other law or rule of the Senate, it shall be in order for a Senator to raise a single point of order that several provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report violate this section. The Presiding Officer may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the provisions against which the Senator raised the point of order. If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of order as to some of the provisions (including provisions of an amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the Senator raised the point of order, then only those provisions (including provisions of an amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the Presiding Officer sustains the point of order shall be deemed stricken pursuant to this section. Before the Presiding Officer rules on such a point of order, any Senator may move to waive such a point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions against which the point of order was raised. Such a motion to waive is amendable in accordance with the rules and precedents of the Senate. After the Presiding Officer rules on such a point of order, any Senator may appeal the ruling of the Presiding Officer on such a point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions on which the Presiding Officer ruled.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Determination of levels</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the levels of new budget authority, budget outlays, new entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;901 &#183; Enforcing discretionary spending limits</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Fiscal years 1991&#8211;1998 enforcement</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sequestration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 902 of this title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any, within any category.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eliminating a breach</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category; except that the health programs set forth in section 906(e) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach. If, within a category, the discretionary spending limits for both new budget authority and outlays are breached, the uniform percentage shall be calculated by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, calculating the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate the breach in new budget authority, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, if any breach in outlays remains, increasing the uniform percentage to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Military personnel</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President uses the authority to exempt any military personnel from sequestration under section 905(h) of this title, each account within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which the authority provided under section 905(h) of this title has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Part-year appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the date specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Look-back</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), the discretionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Within-session sequestration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through (4).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) OMB estimates</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation. Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing the CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estimates. For purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations shall include any new budget authority and outlays for those years in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation that result from previously enacted legislation. Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph for the purposes of this subsection. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to discretionary spending limits</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) Changes in concepts and definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The adjustments produced by the amendments made by title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 or by any other changes in concepts and definitions shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes. Such other changes in concepts and definitions may only be made in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, Government Operations, and Governmental Affairs of the House of Representatives and Senate.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Changes in inflation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) For a budget submitted for budget year 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995, the adjustments produced by changes in inflation shall equal the levels of discretionary new budget authority and outlays in the baseline (calculated using current estimates) subtracted from those levels in that baseline recalculated with the baseline inflators for the budget year only, multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor computed under clause (ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For a budget year the inflation adjustment factor shall equal the ratio between the level of year-over-year inflation measured for the fiscal year most recently completed and the applicable estimated level for that year set forth below:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For 1990, 1.041</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For 1991, 1.052</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For 1993, 1.033</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Inflation shall be measured by the average of the estimated gross national product implicit price deflator index for a fiscal year divided by the average index for the prior fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) For a budget submitted for budget year 1996, 1997, or 1998, the adjustments shall be those necessary to reflect changes in inflation estimates since those of March 31, 1993, set forth on page 46 of House Conference Report 103&#8211;48.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Credit reestimates</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a budget submitted for fiscal year 1993 or 1994, the adjustments produced by reestimates to costs of Federal credit programs shall be, for any such program, a current estimate of new budget authority and outlays associated with a baseline projection of the prior year's gross loan level for that program minus the baseline projection of the prior year's new budget authority and associated outlays for that program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When OMB submits a sequestration report under section 904(g) or (h) of this title for fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 (except as otherwise indicated), OMB shall calculate (in the order set forth below), and the sequestration report, and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31, shall include, adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year through 1998, as follows:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) IRS funding</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that appropriations are enacted that provide additional new budget authority or result in additional outlays (as compared with the CBO baseline constructed in June 1990) for the Internal Revenue Service compliance initiative in any fiscal year, the adjustments for that year shall be those amounts, but shall not exceed the amounts set forth below&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for fiscal year 1991, $191,000,000 in new budget authority and $183,000,000 in outlays;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) for fiscal year 1995, $188,000,000 in new budget authority and $184,000,000 in outlays; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the prior-year outlays resulting from these appropriations of budget authority.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Debt forgiveness</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in calendar year 1990 or 1991, an appropriation is enacted that forgives the Arab Republic of Egypt's foreign military sales indebtedness to the United States and any part of the Government of Poland's indebtedness to the United States, the adjustment shall be the estimated costs (in new budget authority and outlays, in all years) of that forgiveness.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) IMF funding</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 an appropriation is enacted to provide to the International Monetary Fund the dollar equivalent, in terms of Special Drawing Rights, of the increase in the United States quota as part of the International Monetary Fund Ninth General Review of Quotas, the adjustment shall be the amount provided by that appropriation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(D) Emergency appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If, for any fiscal year, appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that the President designates as emergency requirements and that the Congress so designates in statute, the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements and the outlays flowing in all years from such appropriations. This subparagraph shall not apply to appropriations to cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The costs for operation Desert Shield are to be treated as emergency funding requirements not subject to the defense spending limits. Funding for Desert Shield will be provided through the normal legislative process. Desert Shield costs should be accommodated through Allied burden-sharing, subsequent appropriation Acts, and if the President so chooses, through offsets within other defense accounts. Emergency Desert Shield costs mean those incremental costs associated with the increase in operations in the Middle East and do not include costs that would be experienced by the Department of Defense as part of its normal operations absent Operation Desert Shield.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(E) Special allowance for discretionary new budget authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) For each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the domestic category in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.1 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), together with outlays associated therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for the domestic category);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the international category in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.079 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), together with outlays associated therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for the international category);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) if, for fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the amount of new budget authority provided in appropriation Acts exceeds the discretionary spending limit on new budget authority for any category due to technical estimates made by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the adjustment is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed an amount (for 1992 and 1993 together) equal to 0.042 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) if, for fiscal years 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, the amount of new budget authority provided in appropriation Acts exceeds the discretionary spending limit on new budget authority due to technical estimates made by the director&#160;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(F) Special outlay allowance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If in any fiscal year outlays for a category exceed the discretionary spending limit for that category but new budget authority does not exceed its limit for that category (after application of the first step of a sequestration described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, if necessary), the adjustment in outlays is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed $2,500,000,000 in the defense category, $1,500,000,000 in the international category, or $2,500,000,000 in the domestic category (as applicable) in fiscal year 1991, 1992, or 1993, and not to exceed $6,500,000,000 in fiscal year 1994 or 1995 less any of the outlay adjustments made under subparagraph (E) for a category for a fiscal year, and not to exceed 0.5 percent of the adjusted descretionary&#160;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sequestration; look-back</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 of this title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase in that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any prior sequestration as provided by paragraph (2)). OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit increase, if any, in those fiscal years by adding&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eliminating a deficit increase</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) of this section shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) OMB estimates</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation. Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing such CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estimates.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dividing sequestration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">To eliminate the excess deficit in a budget year, half of the required outlay reductions shall be obtained from non-exempt defense accounts (accounts designated as function 050 in the President's fiscal year 1991 budget submission) and half from non-exempt, non-defense accounts (all other non-exempt accounts).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Defense</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each non-exempt defense account shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to carry out subsection (c) of this section, except that, if any military personnel are exempt, adjustments shall be made under the procedure set forth in section 901(a)(3) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline minus any reductions required to be made under sections 901 and 902 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Part-year appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the date specified in subsection (a) of this section, there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any non-exempt budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, shall be subtracted from&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustments to maximum deficit amounts</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Adjustments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1992, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions. When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1993, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be further adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) When submitting the budget for fiscal year 1994, the President may choose to adjust the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions. If the President chooses to adjust the maximum deficit amount when submitting the fiscal year 1994 budget, the President may choose to invoke the same adjustment procedure when submitting the budget for fiscal year 1995. In each case, the President must choose between making no adjustment or the full adjustment described in paragraph (2). If the President chooses to make that full adjustment, then those procedures for adjusting discretionary spending limits described in sections 901(b)(1)(C) and 901(b)(2)(E) of this title, otherwise applicable through fiscal year 1993 or 1994 (as the case may be), shall be deemed to apply for fiscal year 1994 (and 1995 if applicable).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) When the budget for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is submitted and the sequestration reports for those years under section 904 of this title are made (as applicable), if the President does not choose to make the adjustments set forth in subparagraph (B), the maximum deficit amount for that fiscal year shall be adjusted by the amount of the adjustment to discretionary spending limits first applicable for that year (if any) under section 901(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) For each fiscal year the adjustments required to be made with the submission of the President's budget for that year shall also be made when OMB submits the sequestration update report and the final sequestration report for that year, but OMB shall continue to use the economic and technical assumptions in the President's budget for that year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the maximum deficit amounts set forth in section 665 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculations of adjustments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The required increase or decrease shall be calculated as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The baseline deficit or surplus shall be calculated using up-to-date economic and technical assumptions, using up-to-date concepts and definitions, and, in lieu of the baseline levels of discretionary appropriations, using the discretionary spending limits set forth in section 665 of this title as adjusted under section 901 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The net deficit increase or decrease caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any sequestration of direct spending accounts) shall be calculated for each fiscal year by adding&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under section 902(d) of this title applicable to each such fiscal year; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to each such fiscal year resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 902 of this title of direct spending, if any, as contained in OMB's final sequestration report for that year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The amount calculated under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The maximum deficit amount set forth in section 665 of this title shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (C).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The amount calculated under subparagraph (D) shall be the amount of the adjustment required by paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Treatment of deposit insurance</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial estimates</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The initial estimates of the net costs of federal deposit insurance for fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 (assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of the submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993) shall be set forth in that budget.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reestimates</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995, the amount of the reestimate of deposit insurance costs shall be calculated by subtracting the amount set forth under paragraph (1) for that year from the current estimate of deposit insurance costs (but assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;907 &#183; The baseline</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For any budget year, the baseline refers to a projection of current-year levels of new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and the surplus or deficit into the budget year and the outyears based on laws enacted through the applicable date.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Direct spending and receipts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Laws providing or creating direct spending and receipts are assumed to operate in the manner specified in those laws for each such year and funding for entitlement authority is assumed to be adequate to make all payments required by those laws.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) No program with estimated current-year outlays greater than $50 million shall be assumed to expire in the budget year or outyears.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The increase for veterans&#8217; compensation for a fiscal year is assumed to be the same as that required by law for veterans&#8217; pensions unless otherwise provided by law enacted in that session.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund, if expiring, are assumed to be extended at current rates.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Hospital Insurance Trust Fund</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and disbursements of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund shall be included in all calculations required by this Act.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discretionary appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions regarding all amounts other than those covered by subsection (b) of this section:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Inflation of current-year appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level provided for the budget year in full-year appropriation Acts. If for any account a full-year appropriation has not yet been enacted, budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level available in the current year, adjusted sequentially and cumulatively for expiring housing contracts as specified in paragraph (2), for social insurance administrative expenses as specified in paragraph (3), to offset pay absorption and for pay annualization as specified in paragraph (4), for inflation as specified in paragraph (5), and to account for changes required by law in the level of agency payments for personnel benefits other than pay.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expiring housing contracts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">New budget authority to renew expiring multiyear subsidized housing contracts shall be adjusted to reflect the difference in the number of such contracts that are scheduled to expire in that fiscal year and the number expiring in the current year, with the per-contract renewal cost equal to the average current-year cost of renewal contracts.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Social insurance administrative expenses</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Budgetary resources for the administrative expenses of the following trust funds shall be adjusted by the percentage change in the beneficiary population from the current year to that fiscal year: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the railroad retirement account.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Pay annualization; offset to pay absorption</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Current-year new budget authority for Federal employees shall be adjusted to reflect the full 12-month costs (without absorption) of any pay adjustment that occurred in that fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Inflators</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust budgetary resources relating to personnel shall be the percent by which the average of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (wages and salaries, private industry workers) for that fiscal year differs from such index for the current year. The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust all other budgetary resources shall be the percent by which the average of the estimated gross national product fixed-weight price index for that fiscal year differs from the average of such estimated index for the current year.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Current-year appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, for any account, a continuing appropriation is in effect for less than the entire current year, then the current-year amount shall be assumed to equal the amount that would be available if that continuing appropriation covered the entire fiscal year. If law permits the transfer of budget authority among budget accounts in the current year, the current-year level for an account shall reflect transfers accomplished by the submission of, or assumed for the current year in, the President's original budget for the budget year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Up-to-date concepts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In deriving the baseline for any budget year or outyear, current-year amounts shall be calculated using the concepts and definitions that are required for that budget year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sale of assets or prepayment of loans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The sale of an asset or prepayment of a loan shall not alter the deficit or produce any net deficit reduction in the budget baseline, except that the budget baseline estimate shall include asset sales mandated by law before September 18, 1987, and routine, ongoing asset sales and loan prepayments at levels consistent with agency operations in fiscal year 1986;&#160;</p>
