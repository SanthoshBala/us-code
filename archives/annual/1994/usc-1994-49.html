<p class="statutory-body">(4) A separate violation occurs for each day a violation under this subsection continues.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Trial in a civil action under this subsection is in the judicial district in which the rail carrier has its principal operating office or in a district through which the railroad of the rail carrier runs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) If the Secretary finds that a violation of a provision of subchapter III of chapter 311 (except sections 31138 and 31139) or section 31302, 31303, 31304, 31305(b), 31310(g)(1)(A), or 31502 of this title, or a violation of a regulation issued under any of those provisions, has occurred, the Secretary shall issue a written notice to the violator. Such notice shall describe with reasonable particularity the nature of the violation found and the provision which has been violated. The notice shall fix a reasonable time for abatement of the violation, specify the proposed civil penalty, if any, and suggest actions which might be taken in order to abate the violation. The notice shall indicate that the violator may, within 15 days of service, notify the Secretary of the violator's intention to contest the matter. In the event of a contested notice, the Secretary shall afford such violator an opportunity for a hearing, pursuant to section 554 of title 5, following which the Secretary shall issue an order affirming, modifying, or vacating the notice of violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall, not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this subparagraph, establish operational procedures to require a highway safety specialist or other appropriate representative of the Secretary to initiate, at the time of a safety review, compliance review, or other inspection or audit activity, or within a reasonable time thereafter, an enforcement action whenever any of the offenses referred to in paragraph (2)(A) and (B) can be documented, except recordkeeping violations not specified by the Secretary as serious. The procedures shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) specify those serious recordkeeping violations for which an enforcement action shall be initiated, including instances in which the falsification of records of duty status or drivers&#8217; medical certificates is required or permitted, and such other recordkeeping violations as the Secretary determines to be serious; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In general.&#8212;Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any person who is determined by the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to have committed an act which is a violation of a recordkeeping requirement issued by the Secretary under subchapter III of chapter 311 (except sections 31138 and 31139) or section 31502 of this title or which is a violation of chapter 59 of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each offense. Each day of a violation shall constitute a separate offense, except that the total of all civil penalties assessed against any violator for all offenses relating to any single violation shall not exceed $2,500. If the Secretary determines that a serious pattern of safety violations, other than recordkeeping requirements, exists or has occurred, the Secretary may assess a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each offense; except that the maximum fine for each such pattern of safety violations shall not exceed $10,000. If the Secretary determines that a substantial health or safety violation exists or has occurred which could reasonably lead to, or has resulted in, serious personal injury or death, the Secretary may assess a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each offense. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (other than subparagraph (B)), except for recordkeeping violations, no civil penalty shall be assessed under this section against an employee for a violation unless the Secretary determines that such employee's actions constituted gross negligence or reckless disregard for safety, in which case such employee shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Violations pertaining to cdls.&#8212;Any person who is determined by the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to have committed an act which is a violation of section 31302, 31303, 31304, 31305(b), or 31310(g)(1)(A) of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 for each offense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Determination of amount.&#8212;The amount of any civil penalty, and a reasonable time for abatement of the violation, shall by written order be determined by the Secretary, taking into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, and such other matters as justice and public safety may require. In each case, the assessment shall be calculated to induce further compliance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may require any violator served with a notice of violation to post a copy of such notice or statement of such notice in such place or places and for such duration as the Secretary may determine appropriate to aid in the enforcement of subchapter III of chapter 311 (except sections 31138 and 31139) or section 31302, 31303, 31304, 31305(b), or 31502 of this title, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Such civil penalty may be recovered in an action brought by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States in the appropriate district court of the United States or, before referral to the Attorney General, such civil penalty may be compromised by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) If, upon inspection or investigation, the Secretary determines that a violation of a provision of subchapter III of chapter 311 (except sections 31138 and 31139) or section 31302, 31303, 31304, 31305(b), or 31502 of this title or a regulation issued under any of those provisions, or combination of such violations, poses an imminent hazard to safety, the Secretary shall order a vehicle or employee operating such vehicle out of service, or order an employer to cease all or part of the employer's commercial motor vehicle operations. In making any such order, the Secretary shall impose no restriction on any employee or employer beyond that required to abate the hazard. Subsequent to the issuance of the order, opportunity for review shall be provided in accordance with section 554 of title 5, except that such review shall occur not later than 10 days after issuance of such order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In this paragraph, &#8220;imminent hazard&#8221; means any condition of vehicle, employee, or commercial motor vehicle operations which is likely to result in serious injury or death if not discontinued immediately.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Violations pertaining to cdls.&#8212;Any person who knowingly and willfully violates&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall issue regulations establishing penalty schedules designed to induce timely compliance for persons failing to comply promptly with the requirements set forth in any notices and orders under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) Any aggrieved person who, after a hearing, is adversely affected by a final order issued under this section may, within 30 days, petition for review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals in the circuit wherein the violation is alleged to have occurred or where the violator has his principal place of business or residence, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Review of the order shall be based on a determination of whether the Secretary's findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence, or were otherwise not in accordance with law. No objection that has not been urged before the Secretary shall be considered by the court, unless reasonable grounds existed for failure or neglect to do so. The commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(9) All penalties and fines collected under this section shall be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;5301 &#183; Policies, findings, and purposes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Development of Transportation Systems.&#8212;It is in the interest of the United States to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems that embrace various modes of transportation and efficiently maximize mobility of individuals and goods in and through urbanized areas and minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) General Findings.&#8212;Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) more than 70 percent of the population of the United States is located in rapidly expanding urban areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into at least 2 States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the welfare and vitality of urban areas, the satisfactory movement of people and goods within those areas, and the effectiveness of programs aided by the United States Government are jeopardized by deteriorating or inadequate urban transportation service and facilities, the intensification of traffic congestion, and the lack of coordinated, comprehensive, and continuing development planning;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) transportation is the lifeblood of an urbanized society, and the health and welfare of an urbanized society depend on providing efficient, economical, and convenient transportation in and between urban areas;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for many years the mass transportation industry capably and profitably satisfied the transportation needs of the urban areas of the United States but in the early 1970's continuing even minimal mass transportation service in urban areas was threatened because maintaining that transportation service was financially burdensome;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ending that transportation, or the continued increase in its cost to the user, is undesirable and may affect seriously and adversely the welfare of a substantial number of lower income individuals;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) some urban areas were developing preliminary plans for, or carrying out, projects in the early 1970's to revitalize their mass transportation operations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) significant mass transportation improvements are necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals in urban and rural areas of the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) financial assistance by the Government to develop efficient and coordinated mass transportation systems is essential to solve the urban transportation problems referred to in clause (2) of this subsection; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) immediate substantial assistance by the Government is needed to enable mass transportation systems to continue providing vital transportation service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Rapid Urbanization and Continuing Population Dispersal.&#8212;Rapid urbanization and continuing dispersal of the population and activities in urban areas have made the ability of all citizens to move quickly and at a reasonable cost an urgent problem of the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Elderly Individuals and Individuals With Disabilities.&#8212;It is the policy of the Government that elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities have the same right as other individuals to use mass transportation service and facilities. Special efforts shall be made in planning and designing mass transportation service and facilities to ensure that mass transportation can be used by elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities. All programs of the Government assisting mass transportation shall carry out this policy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Preserving the Environment.&#8212;It is the policy of the Government that special effort shall be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside, public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and important historical and cultural assets when planning, designing, and carrying out an urban mass transportation capital project with assistance from the Government under sections 5309 and 5310 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) General Purposes.&#8212;The purposes of this chapter are&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assist in developing improved mass transportation equipment, facilities, techniques, and methods with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the planning and establishment of areawide urban mass transportation systems needed for economical and desirable urban development with the cooperation of public and private mass transportation companies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assist States and local governments and their authorities in financing areawide urban mass transportation systems that are to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as decided by local needs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide financial assistance to State and local governments and their authorities to help carry out national goals related to mobility for elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to establish a partnership that allows a community, with financial assistance from the Government, to satisfy its urban mass transportation requirements.</p>

The agreement shall state that the contingent commitment is not an obligation of the Government. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project under a full financing grant agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. The amount stipulated in an agreement under this paragraph for a fixed guideway project shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Transportation may make an early systems work agreement with an applicant if a record of decision under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) has been issued on the project and the Secretary finds there is reason to believe&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full financing grant agreement for the project will be made; and</p>

A work agreement shall cover the period of time the Secretary considers appropriate. The period may extend beyond the period of current authorization. Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out the work agreement within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms. If an applicant does not carry out the project for reasons within the control of the applicant, the applicant shall repay all Government payments made under the work agreement plus reasonable interest and penalty charges the Secretary establishes in the agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future obligations of the Government and contingent commitments to incur obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent, full financing grant agreements, and early systems work agreements may be not more than the greater of the amount authorized under section 5338(a) of this title to carry out this section or 50 percent of the uncommitted cash balance remaining in the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund (including amounts received from taxes and interest earned that are more than amounts previously obligated), less an amount the Secretary of Transportation reasonably estimates is necessary for grants under this section not covered by a letter.

A grant for the project is for 80 percent of the net project cost, unless the grant recipient requests a lower grant percentage. The remainder shall be provided in cash from a source other than amounts of the Government. Transit system amounts that make up the remainder must be from an undistributed cash surplus, a replacement or depreciation cash fund or reserve, or new capital. The remainder for a planned extension to a fixed guideway system may include the cost of rolling stock previously purchased if the applicant satisfies the Secretary that only amounts other than amounts of the Government were used and that the purchase was made for use on the extension. A refund or reduction of the remainder may be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of the grant of the Government is made at the same time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Loan Term Requirements.&#8212;Except for a loan under subsection (b) of this section, a loan, including a renewal or extension of the loan, may be made, and a security or obligation may be bought, only if it has a maturity date of not more than 40 years. Interest on a loan may not be less than&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a rate the Secretary of the Treasury establishes, considering the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the Government that have remaining periods of maturity comparable to the average maturity of the loan, adjusted to the nearest .125 percent; plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an allowance the Secretary of Transportation considers adequate to cover administrative costs and probable losses.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) Loan Payment Forgiveness.&#8212;A grant agreement for a capital project may forgive repaying the loan and interest in place of a cash grant for the amount forgiven. The amount is part of the grant and part of the contribution of the Government to the cost of the project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k) Limitation on Making Loans and Grants for Projects.&#8212;The Secretary of Transportation may not make a loan under this section for a project for which a grant (except a relocation payment grant) is made under this section. However, the Secretary may make a project grant even though real property for the project has been or will be acquired through a loan under subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(l) Fiscal Capacity Considerations.&#8212;If the Secretary of Transportation gives priority consideration to financing projects that include more than the non-Government share required under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary shall give equal consideration to differences in the fiscal capacity of State and local governments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(m) Allocating Amounts.&#8212;(1) Of the amounts available for grants and loans under this section for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&#8211;1997&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A person applying for, or receiving, assistance for a project described in clause (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection may receive assistance for a project described in another of those clauses.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(n) Undertaking Projects in Advance.&#8212;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may pay the Government's share of the net project cost to a State or local governmental authority that carries out any part of a project described in this section or a substitute transit project described in section 103(e)(4) of title 23 without the aid of amounts of the Government and according to all applicable procedures and requirements if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State or local governmental authority applies for the payment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary approves the payment; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) before carrying out the part of the project, the Secretary approves the plans and specifications for the part in the same way as other projects under this section or section 103(e)(4) of title 23.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The cost of carrying out part of a project includes the amount of interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State or local governmental authority to the extent proceeds of the bonds are expended in carrying out the part. However, the amount of interest under this paragraph may not be more than the most favorable interest terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financial terms.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Transportation shall consider changes in capital project cost indices when determining the estimated cost under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(o) Use of Deobligated Amounts.&#8212;An amount available under this section that is deobligated may be used for any purpose under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10342 &#183; Establishment</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may establish and abolish joint boards as necessary to carry out section 10341 of this title. Except as provided in this section, a joint board is composed of a member from each State in which transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title is, or is proposed to be, provided. The Commission may appoint an individual nominated under subsection (b) of this section as a member of a joint board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The member of a joint board from a State shall be nominated by the State authority having jurisdiction to regulate intrastate transportation by motor vehicle on the highways of that State. If there is no such authority in that State or if that authority does not nominate a member when requested by the Commission, the chief executive officer of the State may nominate the member. If both that State authority and the chief executive officer of that State do not nominate a member when requested, the board is constituted without a member from that State if the Commission has appointed members for at least 2 other States to the board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a matter required to be referred to a joint board involves the operation of a motor carrier in or through a place outside the United States, if only one State is involved or if only one State nominates an individual to be a member of the joint board, that State may nominate and the Commission may appoint not more than 3 members to the board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) A substitution in the membership of a joint board may be made at any time in the same manner as an initial nomination and appointment under this section.</p>

Subchapter II of this chapter applies to an initial decision of a joint board. However, a joint board may report to the Interstate Commerce Commission its conclusions on evidence received without making an initial decision. When a joint board makes a report instead of an initial decision, the Commission shall decide the matter. The Commission may consider the conclusions of the joint board in making its decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A joint board may make an initial decision or report of its conclusions only by a majority vote. However, if only one member of the board participates in the proceeding, that member shall make the initial decision alone.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member of a joint board does not participate in a proceeding referred to that board, after notice of the proceeding, the State from which that member was appointed waives its right to act in that proceeding. The waiver does not affect the duty or power of remaining members of the board to continue the proceeding and make an initial decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In addition to decisions made under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall decide a matter referred to a joint board when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the authority of each State from which a member of the board may be appointed waives action on a matter referred to that board;</p>

The space and facilities shall be available for the use of joint boards and for members and representatives of those boards cooperating with the Commission or with another department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government. If suitable space is not available in the Interstate Commerce Commission building, the Administrator shall assign space in another building in convenient proximity to it.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall exempt from its jurisdiction under this subchapter the transportation of commodities by water contract carrier when the Commission finds that the transportation is not actually and substantially competitive with transportation provided by a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or II of this chapter because of the inherent nature of the commodities transported, their requirement of special equipment, or their shipment in bulk. The Commission may prescribe conditions applicable to an exemption under this subsection. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a water contract carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subtitle over transportation by a water common carrier provided between the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia, and Alaska if, before January 3, 1959&#8212;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10701 &#183; Standards for rates, classifications, through routes, rules, and practices</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A rate (other than a rail rate), classification, rule, or practice related to transportation or service provided by a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title must be reasonable. A through route established by such a carrier (including a rail carrier) must be reasonable. Divisions of joint rates by those carriers (including rail carriers) must be made without unreasonable discrimination against a participating carrier and must be reasonable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">[(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 96&#8211;448, title II, &#167;201(b)(2), Oct. 14, 1980, 94 Stat. 1900.]</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title may not discriminate in its rates against a connecting line of another carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under either of those subchapters or unreasonably discriminate against that line in the distribution of traffic that is not routed specifically by the shipper.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding to determine whether a rate for transportation or service provided by a common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 of this title complies with subsection (a) of this section, the good will, earning power, or certificate or permit under which that carrier is operating may not be considered or admitted as evidence of the value of the property of that carrier. When the carrier receives a certificate or permit under chapter 109 of this title, it is considered to have agreed to this subsection for itself and for all transferees of that certificate or permit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Except as provided in subsection (f), in proceedings to determine the reasonableness of rate levels for a motor carrier or group of motor carriers, or in proceedings to determine the reasonableness of a territorial rate structure where rates are proposed through agreements authorized by section 10706(b) of this title, the Commission shall authorize revenue levels that are adequate under honest, economical, and efficient management to cover total operating expenses, including the operation of leased equipment and depreciation, plus a reasonable profit. The standards and procedures adopted by the Commission under this subsection shall allow the carriers to achieve revenue levels that will provide a flow of net income, plus depreciation, adequate to support prudent capital outlays, assure the repayment of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound motor carrier transportation system in the United States, and take into account reasonable estimated or foreseeable future costs. Any complaint brought against a motor carrier (other than a carrier described in subsection (f)(1)(A)) by a person (other than a motor carrier) for unreasonably high rates for past or future transportation shall be determined under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Procedures for Resolving Claims Involving Unfiled, Negotiated Transportation Rates.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;When a claim is made by a motor carrier of property (other than a household goods carrier) providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, by a freight forwarder (other than a household goods freight forwarder), or by a party representing such a carrier or freight forwarder regarding the collection of rates or charges for such transportation in addition to those originally billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder for such transportation, the person against whom the claim is made may elect to satisfy the claim under the provisions of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection, upon showing that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the carrier or freight forwarder is no longer transporting property or is transporting property for the purpose of avoiding the application of this subsection; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to the claim&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the person was offered a transportation rate by the carrier or freight forwarder other than that legally on file with the Commission for the transportation service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the person tendered freight to the carrier or freight forwarder in reasonable reliance upon the offered transportation rate;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the carrier or freight forwarder did not properly or timely file with the Commission a tariff providing for such transportation rate or failed to enter into an agreement for contract carriage;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) such transportation rate was billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the carrier or freight forwarder demands additional payment of a higher rate filed in a tariff.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If there is a dispute as to the showing under subparagraph (A), such dispute shall be resolved by the court in which the claim is brought. If there is a dispute as to the showing under subparagraph (B), such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission. Pending the resolution of any such dispute, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier or freight forwarder. Satisfaction of the claim under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection shall be binding on the parties, and the parties shall not be subject to chapter 119 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Claims involving shipments weighing 10,000 pounds or less.&#8212;A person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim if the shipments each weighed 10,000 pounds or less, by payment of 20 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Claims involving shipments weighing more than 10,000 pounds.&#8212;A person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim if the shipments each weighed more than 10,000 pounds, by payment of 15 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Claims involving public warehousemen.&#8212;Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim by payment of 5 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid if such person is a public warehouseman. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Effects of election.&#8212;When a person from whom additional legally applicable freight rates or charges are sought does not elect to use the provisions of paragraph (2), (3), or (4), the person may pursue all rights and remedies existing under this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Stay of additional compensation.&#8212;When a person proceeds under this section to challenge the reasonableness of the legally applicable freight rate or charges being claimed by a carrier or freight forwarder described in paragraph (1) in addition to those already billed and collected, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier or freight forwarder until the Commission has made a determination as to the reasonableness of the challenged rate as applied to the freight of the person against whom the claim is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Limitation on statutory construction.&#8212;Except as authorized in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (9) of this subsection, nothing in this subsection shall relieve a motor common carrier of the duty to file and adhere to its rates, rules, and classifications as required in sections 10761 and 10762 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Notification of election.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) General rule.&#8212;A person must notify the carrier or freight forwarder as to its election to proceed under paragraph (2), (3), or (4). Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), such election may be made at any time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Demands for payment initially made after date of enactment.&#8212;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder initially demands the payment of additional freight charges after the date of the enactment of this subsection and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7) at the time of the making of such initial demand, the election must be made not later than the later of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Pending suits for collection made before or on date of enactment.&#8212;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder has filed, before or on the date of the enactment of this subsection, a suit for the collection of additional freight charges and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7), the election must be made not later than the 90th day following the date on which such notification is received.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Demands for payment made before or on date of enactment.&#8212;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder has demanded the payment of additional freight charges, and has not filed a suit for the collection of such additional freight charges, before or on the date of the enactment of this subsection and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7), the election must be made not later than the later of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If the Commission determines, under section 10709 of this title, that a rail carrier has market dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate applies, the rate established by such carrier for such transportation must be reasonable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any proceeding to determine the reasonableness of a rate described in paragraph (1) of this subsection&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the shipper challenging such rate shall have the burden of proving that such rate is not reasonable if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such rate (I) is authorized under section 10707a of this title, and (II) results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is less than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 10707a(e)(2)(A) of this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such rate does not meet the description set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph, but the Commission does not begin an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title to determine whether such rate is reasonable; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate shall have the burden of proving that such rate is reasonable if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such rate (I) is greater than that authorized under section 10707a of this title, or (II) results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 10707a(e)(2)(A) of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Commission begins an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title to determine whether such rate is reasonable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining whether a rate established by a rail carrier is reasonable for purposes of this section, the Commission shall recognize the policy of this subtitle that rail carriers shall earn adequate revenues, as established by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A rate for transportation or other service provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not be established below a reasonable minimum. Any rate for transportation by such a rail carrier that does not contribute to the going concern value of such carrier is presumed to be not reasonable. A rate that contributes to the going concern value of such carrier is conclusively presumed not to be below a reasonable minimum.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rate for transportation by a rail carrier that equals or exceeds the variable cost of providing the transportation is conclusively presumed to contribute to the going concern value of such rail carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Upon the filing of a complaint alleging that a rate is in violation of this subsection, the Commission shall take final action thereon by the 90th day after the date such complaint is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines, based on the record after opportunity for a hearing, that a rate is in violation of this subsection, the Commission shall order such rate to be raised, but only to the minimum level required by this subsection. The complainant shall have the burden of proving that such rate is in violation of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of this subsection, variable costs shall be determined under formulas or procedures prescribed or certified by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the determination of variable costs for purposes of minimum rate regulation, the Commission shall, on application of the rail carrier proposing the rate, determine only the costs of such carrier and only those costs of the specific service in question unless the specific information is not available.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rates, including divisions of joint rates, and classifications for transportation and service it may provide under this subtitle; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) rules and practices on matters related to that transportation or service, including rules and practices on&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issuing tickets, receipts, bills of lading, and manifests;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) carrying of baggage;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the manner and method of presenting, marking, packing, and delivering property for transportation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) facilities for transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A contract carrier, except a motor contract carrier of property, providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall establish, and file with the Commission, actual and minimum rates for the transportation it may provide under this subtitle and rules and practices related to those rates. However, this subsection does not require a motor contract carrier to maintain the same rates and rules related to those rates for the same transportation provided to shippers served by it. The Commission may grant relief from this subsection when relief is consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a contract carrier or group of contract carriers or on its own initiative for a water contract carrier or group of water contract carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Contracts of Carriage for Motor Contract Carriers.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) General rule.&#8212;A motor contract carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall enter into a written agreement, separate from the bill of lading or receipt, for each contract for the provision of transportation subject to such jurisdiction which is entered into after the 90th day following the date of the enactment of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Minimum content requirements.&#8212;The written agreement shall, at a minimum&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify the parties thereto;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) commit the shipper to tender and the carrier to transport a series of shipments;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) contain the contract rate or rates for the transportation service to be or being provided; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) state that it provides for the assignment of motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of the shipper; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) state that it provides that the service is designed to meet the distinct needs of the shipper.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Retention by carrier.&#8212;All written agreements entered into by a motor contract carrier under paragraph (1) shall be retained by the carrier while in effect and for a minimum period of 3 years thereafter and shall be made available to the Commission upon request.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Random audits by commission.&#8212;The Commission shall conduct periodic random audits to ensure that motor contract carriers are complying with this subsection and are adhering to the rates set forth in their agreements.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10704 &#183; Authority and criteria: rates, classifications, rules, and practices prescribed by Interstate Commerce Commission</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When the Interstate Commerce Commission, after a full hearing, decides that a rate charged or collected by a carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, or that a classification, rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this subtitle, the Commission may prescribe the rate (including a maximum or minimum rate, or both), classification, rule, or practice to be followed. The Commission may order the carrier to stop the violation. When a rate, classification, rule, or practice is prescribed under this subsection, the affected carrier may not publish, charge, or collect a different rate and shall adopt the classification and observe the rule or practice prescribed by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall maintain and revise as necessary standards and procedures for establishing revenue levels for rail carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under that subchapter that are adequate, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business. The Commission shall make an adequate and continuing effort to assist those carriers in attaining revenue levels prescribed under this paragraph. However, a rate, classification, rule, or practice of a rail carrier may be maintained at a particular level to protect the traffic of another carrier or mode of transportation only if the Commission finds that the rate or classification, or rule or practice related to it, reduces or would reduce the going concern value of the carrier charging the rate. Revenue levels established under this paragraph should&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide a flow of net income plus depreciation adequate to support prudent capital outlays, assure the repayment of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, and cover the effects of inflation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall conclude a proceeding under paragraph (2) of this subsection within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and thereafter as necessary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) On the basis of the standards and procedures under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission shall, within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and on an annual basis thereafter, determine which rail carriers are earning adequate revenues.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When the Commission decides that a rate charged or collected by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a motor common carrier for providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title by itself, with another motor common carrier, with a rail, express, or water common carrier, or any of them;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a water common carrier for providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a household goods freight forwarder for providing service subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter IV of chapter 105 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">or that a classification, rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this chapter, the Commission shall prescribe the rate (including a maximum or minimum rate, or both), classification, rule, or practice to be followed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When prescribing a rate, classification, rule, or practice for transportation or service by common carriers other than by rail carrier, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, the effect of the prescribed rate, classification, rule, or practice on the movement of traffic by that carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) When prescribing a rate, classification, rule, or practice for transportation or service by common carriers other than by rail carrier or motor carrier, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, the need for revenues that are sufficient, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to let the carrier provide that transportation or service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the carrier is a motor or water common carrier or a household goods freight forwarder, the Commission shall also consider the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation or service by that carrier at the lowest cost consistent with providing that transportation or service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the carrier is a motor common carrier or a household goods freight forwarder, the Commission shall also consider the inherent advantages of transportation by motor common carrier or the inherent nature of household goods freight forwarding, respectively.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When the Commission finds that a minimum rate of a contract carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title, or a rule or practice related to the rate or the value of the service under it, violates this chapter or the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, the Commission may prescribe the minimum rate, rule, or practice for the carrier that is desirable in the public interest and will promote that policy. In prescribing the rate, the Commission may not give a motor or water contract carrier an advantage or preference in competition with a motor or water common carrier, respectively, if an advantage or preference is unreasonable or inconsistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When prescribing a minimum rate, or rule or practice related to a rate, for a contract carrier, the Commission shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cost of the transportation provided by the carrier; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect of a prescribed minimum rate, or rule or practice, on the movement of traffic by that carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding involving competition between carriers of different modes of transportation subject to this subtitle, except rail carriers, the Commission, in determining whether a rate is less than a reasonable minimum rate, shall consider the facts and circumstances involved in moving the traffic by the mode of carrier to which the rate is applicable. Subject to the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, rates of a carrier may not be maintained at a particular level to protect the traffic of another mode of transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) In a proceeding involving a proposed increase or decrease in rail carrier rates, the Commission shall specifically consider allegations that the increase or decrease would (1) change the rate relationships between commodities, ports, places, regions, areas, or other particular descriptions of traffic (without regard to previous Commission consideration or approval of those relationships), and (2) have a significant adverse effect on the competitive position of shippers or consignees served by the rail carrier proposing the increase or decrease. The Commission shall investigate to determine whether the change or effect violates this subtitle when it finds that those allegations are substantially supported on the record. The investigation may be made either before or after the proposed increase or decrease becomes effective and either in that proceeding or in another proceeding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on complaint. A complaint under subsection (a) of this section must be made under section 11701 of this title, but the proceeding may also be in extension of a complaint pending before the Commission. A complaint under subsection (c) of this section must contain a full statement of the facts and the reasons for the complaint and must be made under oath.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10705 &#183; Authority: through routes, joint classifications, rates, and divisions prescribed by Interstate Commerce Commission</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may, and shall when it considers it desirable in the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, joint rates (including maximum or minimum rates or both), the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which those routes must be operated, for a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II (except a motor common carrier of property), or III of chapter 105 of this title. When one of the carriers on a through route is a water carrier, the Commission shall prescribe a differential between an all-rail rate and a joint rate related to the water carrier if the differential is justified.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require a rail carrier to include in a through route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad and any intermediate railroad operated with it under common management or control if that intermediate railroad lies between the terminals of the through route only when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) required under section 10741&#8211;10744 or 11103 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) one of the carriers is a water carrier;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) inclusion of those lines would make the through route unreasonably long when compared with a practicable alternative through route that could be established; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Commission decides that the proposed through route is needed to provide adequate, and more efficient or economic, transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall give reasonable preference, subject to this subsection, to the rail carrier originating the traffic when prescribing through routes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may not prescribe&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a through route, classification, practice, or rate between a street electric passenger railway not engaged in the general business of transporting freight in addition to its passenger and express business and (i) a rail carrier of a different character, or (ii) a water common carrier; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a through route or joint rate applicable to it to assist a participating carrier to meet its financial needs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may, and shall when it considers it desirable in the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, joint rates (including maximum or minimum rates or both), the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which those routes must be operated, for a motor common carrier of property providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title with another such carrier or with a water common carrier of property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may not require a motor common carrier of property, without its consent, to include in a through route substantially less than the entire length of its route and the route of any intermediate carrier which is operated in conjunction and under common management or control with such motor common carrier of property which lies between the termini of such proposed through routes (A) unless inclusion of such routes would make the through route unreasonably circuitous as compared with another practicable through route which could otherwise be established, or (B) unless the Commission finds that the through route proposed to be established is needed in order to provide adequate, more efficient, or more economic transportation. In prescribing through routes the Commission shall, so far as is consistent with the public interest, and subject to the preceding sentence, give reasonable preference to the carrier which originates the traffic.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall prescribe the division of joint rates to be received by a carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under chapter 105 of this title when it decides that a division of joint rates established by the participating carriers under section 10703 of this title, or under a decision of the Commission under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, does or will violate section 10701 of this title. When prescribing the division of joint rates of a rail carrier, water carrier, or motor common carrier of property under this subsection, the Commission shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of revenue required by the carriers to pay their operating expenses and taxes and receive a fair return on the property held and used for transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the importance of the transportation to the public;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether a particular participating carrier is an originating, intermediate, or delivering line; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) other circumstances that ordinarily, without regard to the mileage traveled, entitle one carrier to a different proportion of a rate than another carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a division of a joint rate prescribed under a decision of the Commission is later found to violate section 10701 of this title, the Commission may decide what division would have been reasonable and order adjustment to be made retroactive to the date the complaint was filed, the date the order for an investigation was made, or a later date that the Commission decides is justified. The Commission may make a decision under this paragraph effective as part of its original decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the Commission suspends, for investigation, a tariff of a rail carrier, water common carrier, or motor common carrier of property that would cancel a through route, joint rate, or classification without the consent of all carriers that are parties to it or without authorization of the Commission, the carrier proposing the cancellation has the burden of proving that cancellation is consistent with the public interest without regard to subsection (a)(2) of this section. In determining whether a cancellation involving a rail carrier is consistent with the public interest, the Commission shall, to the extent applicable&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) compare the distance traveled and the average transportation time and expense required using (A) the through route, and (B) alternative routes, between the places served by the through route;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider any reduction in energy consumption that may result from cancellation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider the overall impact of cancellation on the shippers and carriers that are affected by it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Commission may begin a proceeding under subsection (a) or (b) of this section on its own initiative or on complaint. The Commission must complete all evidentiary proceedings to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier within 9 months after the complaint is filed if the proceeding is brought on complaint or within 18 months after the commencement of a proceeding on the initiative of the Commission. The Commission must take final action by the 180th day after completion of the evidentiary proceedings, except that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when the proceeding involves a railroad in reorganization or a contention that the divisions at issue do not cover the variable costs of handling the traffic, the Commission shall give the proceedings preference over all other proceedings and shall take final action at the earliest practicable time, which in no event may exceed 100 days after the completion of the evidentiary proceedings; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in all cases other than those specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission may decide to extend such a proceeding to permit its fair and expeditious completion, but whenever the Commission decides to extend a proceeding pursuant to this clause, it must report its reasons to Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a carrier begins a proceeding to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier under this section by filing a complaint with the Commission, the carrier must also file all of the evidence in support of its position with the complaint and, during the course of the proceeding may only file rebuttal or reply evidence unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) When the Commission receives a notice of intent to begin a proceeding to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier under this section, the Commission shall allow the party filing the notice the same right to discovery that a party would have on filing a complaint under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) When there is a shortage of equipment, congestion of traffic, or other emergency declared by the Commission, it may prescribe temporary through routes that are desirable in the public interest on its own initiative or on application without regard to subsection (f) of this section, subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title, and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any motor common carrier of property who is a party to a through route and joint rate, whether established by such carrier under section 10703 of this title or prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, shall promptly pay divisions or make interline settlements, as the case may be, with other carriers which are parties to such through route and joint rate. In the event of undue delinquency in the settlement of such divisions or interline settlements, such through routes and joint rates may be suspended or canceled under rules prescribed by the Commission.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10705a &#183; Joint rate surcharges and cancellations</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may publish and apply a surcharge increasing or decreasing the through charge applicable to any movement between points designated by the surcharging carrier subject to a joint rate. Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of the other carriers that are party in such joint rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A carrier earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may not apply such a surcharge to any movement on a line operated by such carrier which carried more than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any surcharge applied pursuant to this subsection must be applied in equal dollar amounts to the movement subject to the surcharge over all routes between the points designated by the surcharging carrier which such carrier participates in under the joint rate involved, and when the surcharge increases the through charges, under any of such carrier's single line rates between the same points.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever a rail carrier applies a surcharge increasing a through charge pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, any other rail carrier that participates in any movement subject to such surcharge may cancel the application of such surcharge to any route participated in by such other carrier, if such carrier makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A rail carrier may cancel the application of a surcharge under this paragraph if such carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the surcharging carrier's share of the revenues, at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, from its participation in the movement over the route involved would have been equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, under either&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a new rate division increasing the share of the surcharging carrier;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a new higher lawful rate published by the canceling carrier; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a new, lesser surcharge which shall be prescribed by the Commission upon and in conformity with the request of the carrier proposing to cancel the surcharge. Any such prescribed surcharge shall, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the original surcharge was filed with the Commission, provide the carrier proposing the original surcharge revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of such surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The canceling tariff shall only become effective if the rail carrier proposing to cancel the application of the surcharge makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge, the tariff shall become effective on one day's notice after such determination is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of a new rate, division, or surcharge prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph, the tariff shall become effective on the date such new rate, division, or surcharge becomes effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The remedy available to a rail carrier canceling the application of a surcharge under this paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedy available to such carrier under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge to a route to which such surcharge applies if a shipper moving traffic over such route demonstrates to the Commission that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is no competitive alternative to such route for the movement of the traffic involved that is not subject to such surcharge; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the surcharging carrier's share of the revenues from its participation in the movement over the route to which such surcharge applies, under the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, with the surcharge, would be greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission cancels the application of a surcharge to a particular route pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, would equal 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route, and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such a surcharge without any further proceedings under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection unless, for the one-year period preceding the surcharge, such carrier has concurred in all rate increases of general applicability applicable to the joint rate to which such surcharge applies and agreed to by all other carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection increasing a through charge applicable to a particular movement more than once each calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a rail carrier may, by tariff, reduce the total charges applicable to a movement over any specific joint line or single line route or routes in which such carrier participates, if such reduction does not lower the total charges applicable to such movement to a level that is less than the lowest total charges applicable to the same movement over a competing route. Any such reduction may be made without the concurrence of any other rail carrier, and shall be borne solely by the carrier reducing the charge. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the right of a carrier to reduce rates over routes not in direct competition between the same points with routes to which it has applied a surcharge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier not earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the most recent calendar year for which traffic data is available; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a rail carrier earning adequate revenues, as so determined, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 1,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in such most recent calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of any rail carrier. Any such surcharge may be allocated, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection, in different amounts among different movements between different origins and destinations, and shall accrue solely to the surcharging carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier may apply a surcharge under this subsection if, prior to the application of such surcharge, that portion of the charges applicable to traffic to and from the line to which the surcharge applies and accruing to the surcharging carrier does not provide such carrier revenues adequate to cover&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from such line; plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 100 percent of such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line, which shall include all costs necessary to sustain service on the line.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall, within 120 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, complete a proceeding to define the term &#8220;reasonably expected costs&#8221; as used in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. In the interim, the term shall be construed in accordance with Rail Services Planning Office subsidy standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Upon petition of a shipper located upon a line to which a surcharge under this subsection is applied, the Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge under this subsection if such shipper demonstrates to the Commission that, after application of the surcharge, the surcharging carrier's revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon the line to which the surcharge applies exceed 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A rail carrier's revenue from all traffic originating or terminating upon a line shall be presumed to exceed 110 percent of its variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus its reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line if the complaining shipper demonstrates that the carrier is earning revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon such line that result in a revenue-variable cost percentage that is equal to or greater than the revenue-variable cost percentage applicable in that year under section 10709(d) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A surcharging carrier may rebut the presumption set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph by demonstrating to the Commission that its reasonably expected costs for operating the line to which the surcharge applies exceed the percentage of variable cost set forth in such clause (i).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a finding by the Commission that application of the surcharge will produce revenues in excess of 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of transporting traffic to or from the line plus its reasonably expected costs for operating the line, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which would produce revenues equal to such figure and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such surcharges as will generate such revenues without any further proceedings, subject only to the right of a shipper to proceed under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection that results in any shipper being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate the line to which such surcharge applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon complaint of a shipper, the Commission shall determine whether the shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Commission finds that a complaining shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission may reallocate the surcharge among the traffic originating or terminating on the line to which the surcharge applies, but may not order relief which would result in the surcharging carrier earning revenues less than those which the carrier would have earned had the surcharge been applied as filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A shipper may, in a single complaint, seek relief under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. In any such complaint, the Commission shall first determine the right to relief under paragraph (3) and shall grant such relief as is appropriate under such paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any proceeding brought before the Commission challenging the application or amount of a surcharge under this subsection, whether the surcharge is claimed to violate this subsection or some other provision of this chapter, the Commission shall not suspend the application of any such surcharge unless the person filing the verified statement required by section 10707(c) of this title, in addition to the matters required by such section, also makes the demonstration required by paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection. If the demonstration required by such paragraph (3)(A) is made, the Commission may suspend the application of only so much of the surcharge as will produce revenues in excess of the amount so demonstrated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any prior agreement in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, or any requirement of the Commission, a rail carrier may cancel the application of a joint rate to a through route in which it participates, without the concurrence of any other rail carrier that is a party to such joint rate, unless another rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route makes the demonstration described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The application of a joint rate to a through route may not be canceled under this subsection if a rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route from an origin or destination served by such route demonstrates to the Commission that the canceling carrier's share of the revenues, under the joint rate in effect at the time the application of the joint rate is canceled, is equal to or greater than&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such lesser percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost as such carrier earns over a competing through route to which application of the joint rate has not been canceled, or over a competing single line route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a complaining party is unable to make the demonstration required by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission may suspend the tariff canceling the joint rate only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a complaining carrier publishes a new rate division or a new higher lawful rate which increases the canceling carrier's share of the revenues over such route to the amount calculated under paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of this subsection, whichever is less; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a complaining carrier or shipper petitions the Commission and the Commission imposes a surcharge, in conformity with such petition, upon the joint rate which will accrue solely to the canceling carrier and which, in conjunction with the canceling carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the tariff canceling the joint rate was filed, will provide the canceling carrier revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Unless a new rate, division, or surcharge described in this paragraph becomes effective within 120 days after the proposed effective date of the rate cancellation, the canceling tariff shall, nevertheless, become effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the demonstration described in paragraph (2) is made or a new rate, division, or surcharge described in paragraph (3) becomes effective, the tariff canceling the joint rate shall be considered by the Commission in accordance with section 10705 of this title. The existing joint rate or the new rate division, or surcharge, shall remain in effect during the pendency of the Commission's consideration.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under this subsection and a rate other than a joint rate is or has been published by the canceling carrier to apply to such route, such rate shall thereafter apply in lieu of all other rates (except joint rates subsequently agreed to by such carrier) and any through rate of which such rate is a factor shall divide as the separate factors of such rate are made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission under section 10705(a) of this title to prescribe joint rates which provide a rail carrier participating in such joint rate revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over each route to which such rate applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any increase or decrease in revenue resulting from the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, or from the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section, shall accrue solely to or be borne solely by the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a class III rail carrier which participates in a through route to which a surcharge has been applied under subsection (a) of this section by a carrier operating in the same rate territory as such class III carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the application of such surcharge to such route provides, in the absence of any increase in the joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, revenues from traffic moving over such route to such surcharging carrier in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs over such route, such surcharging carrier shall, from the date of such demonstration, share those revenues from such route, from the surcharge and the applicable joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs with all class III rail carriers in the same rate territory participating in such route, on the basis of their existing divisions of the joint rate to which the surcharge applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, whenever a rail carrier proposes to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or to cancel the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section and another rail carrier subsequently agrees to a new rate division or a new lawful rate that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over a particular through route subject to a joint rate, such other rail carrier shall also agree to any other new rate division and new lawful rate&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is proposed within 120 days after the date of the first agreement; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over a competing through route subject to such joint rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier shall not be required to agree under this subsection to any proposed new division or new rate which would&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to less than (i) 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, or (ii) such lesser percent of its variable costs as such carrier earns from such movement over a competing through route with respect to which such carrier has agreed to a new division or rate;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to an amount in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route by a dollar amount in excess of the greatest dollar reduction which such carrier has agreed to make, for purposes of increasing the surcharging or canceling carrier's share, to its share of the total through charges for a movement over any competing through route; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route in an amount in excess of such carrier's pro rata share (based on established divisions for movements over such route) of the increase of the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over such route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) A rail carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section shall file a tariff with the Commission in accordance with section 10762 of this title. Such a tariff may not become effective until the expiration of the 45-day period (or such longer period as the filing carrier specifies) beginning on the date such tariff is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Any rail rate to which a surcharge is applied under this section shall be subject to section 10701a and 10709 of this title, and any such surcharge shall constitute a rate increase for purposes of such sections.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of rate regulation under section 10701a of this title&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only the rail carrier proposing a surcharge under this section shall be required to defend such surcharge; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the reasonableness of the surcharge and the revenues received by the rail carrier proposing the surcharge under the joint rate to which the surcharge applies shall be determined without regard to amount received and services performed by other rail carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in subsection (i), (j), or (k) of this section, if the application of a surcharge or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under this section is found to constitute a violation of any provision of this subtitle, such violation shall not be ordered remedied in any manner which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to provide service over any route under a rate that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing such service; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (b) of this section to provide service over the route to which such surcharge applies in a manner that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from the line to which the surcharge applies, plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of providing service over such line.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Within 5 days after the request of a rail carrier participating in a joint rate subject to a surcharge or cancellation under this section, a shipper moving traffic over a route to which such surcharge or cancellation applies, or an affected port, the Commission shall make available to such carrier, shipper, or port the Commission's determination of the variable costs and revenues, over the route or routes to which the surcharge or cancellation applies, of the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) Whenever a class III rail carrier, in a protest filed with the Commission, makes a prima facie showing that the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section will have an adverse effect on competition, the Commission shall investigate such protest. If, on the basis of such investigation, the Commission finds that the protested surcharge or cancellation is or is intended to be anticompetitive, the Commission shall, within 30 days after the date such protest is filed, enter an order rescinding such surcharge or cancellation, and may, on presentation of an adequate record, prescribe new joint rates or divisions of joint rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No order prescribed under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides revenues less than 110 percent of the variable cost of providing such service unless the Commission determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to avoid anticompetitive action and to preserve service on the route involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Any class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section may protest such surcharge or cancellation whenever&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such surcharge or cancellation affects the sole remaining route available to that carrier for that traffic; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) such carrier demonstrates that alternative transportation is available or that a shipper dependent on that carrier will suffer significant market loss because of such surcharge or cancellation; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such surcharge or cancellation, alone or when considered in conjunction with other surcharges or cancellations affecting the carrier, is likely to unduly impair a carrier's ability to earn an adequate rate of return.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission may, after an investigation on the basis of a protest under this subsection, prescribe a lesser surcharge or a different division of the joint rate. The Commission shall grant the surcharging or canceling carrier revenues not less than 110 percent of its variable cost of the movement involved, unless it determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to preserve service on the route involved. Any action by the Commission based on a protest under this subsection shall be taken within 30 days after the date such protest is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission prescribes a different division of a joint rate under this paragraph, the Commission shall, upon petition of the surcharging or canceling carrier or the protesting class III rail carrier, reopen the proceeding in which such division was prescribed to reconsider whether such prescribed division is reasonable. If, on the basis of such reconsideration, the Commission determines that such division is not reasonable, it shall prescribe a new, reasonable division of the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation applied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Upon the complaint of a class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section that such surcharge or cancellation will result in differences or greater differences in rates, including any surcharges, for the traffic to which the surcharge or cancellation applies over different routes in which the surcharging or canceling carrier participates&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) from a single origin point to destination points within a 75 mile direct radius from the destination point on such class III rail carrier; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to a single destination point from origin points within a 75 mile direct radius from the origin point on such class III rail carrier,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall investigate such complaint and shall, within 30 days after the date such complaint is filed, take such actions, including rescinding surcharges or cancellations or prescribing new joint rates or surcharges, as it determines are required to eliminate such differences in rates, unless it finds that such actions are not warranted by the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in the preservation of rail service on the route involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No action taken by the Commission under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides a revenue to variable cost ratio over such route less than that provided under the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation was applied or less than 110 percent, whichever is greater, unless the Commission determines that the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in preserving service over such route warrants requiring the surcharging or canceling carrier to provide service at a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding subsection (m)(1) of this section, if, in a proceeding under this subsection or under subsection (i) or (j) of this section, the Commission considers whether to require the revenues of a carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to be less than 110 percent of its variable costs (as calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology), such surcharging or canceling carrier may prove its actual variable costs on the basis of evidence other than unadjusted costs calculated using such Rail Form A cost finding methodology. Such evidence shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(l) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall, upon petition by a class II or III rail carrier participating in such route, prescribe a new compensatory through rate or rates over such route within 30 days after the date such petition is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(m) For purposes of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) variable costs for a class I rail carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier's unadjusted costs, calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology (or an alternative methodology adopted by the Commission in lieu thereof) and indexed quarterly to account for current wage and price levels in the region in which the carrier operates;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) variable costs for a rail carrier other than class I shall be presumed to be the average variable costs of all class I rail carriers in the region in which such carrier operates (as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection) unless a rail carrier rebuts such presumption with other proof of variable costs; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at the option of a carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section, revenue share may be determined by reference to past revenue settlements actually made in the most recent calendar year by connecting lines.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(n) Surcharges applied under subsection (a) or (c) of this section and cancellations under subsection (c) of this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 10726(a)(1)(B) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(o) The Special Counsel of the Commission may, consistent with the rail transportation policy in section 10101a of this title, provide assistance to class III rail carriers and small businesses in preparing actions under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(p)(1) The authority to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, and (except as provided in paragraph (2)) the authority to cancel such a surcharge, shall expire 3 years after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 unless extended for one additional year by the Commission upon petition of any rail carrier and for good cause shown.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any surcharge lawfully applied under subsection (a) of this section shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms following the expiration of the provisions of this section. Any such surcharge applied during the 45-day period immediately preceding the date of the expiration of the provisions of this section shall, notwithstanding such expiration, be subject to cancellation under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section during the 45-day period beginning on the date such surcharge is applied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) In this subsection&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &#8220;affiliate&#8221; means a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control or ownership with another person and &#8220;ownership&#8221; refers to equity holdings in a business entity of at least 5 percent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &#8220;single-line rate&#8221; refers to a rate or allowance proposed by a single rail carrier that is applicable only over its line and for which the transportation (exclusive of terminal services by switching, drayage or other terminal carriers or agencies) can be provided by that carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title that is a party to an agreement of at least 2 rail carriers or an agreement with a class of carriers referred to in subsection (d)(1)(B)&#8211;(E) of this section, that relates to rates (including charges between rail carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, publication, or establishment of them, shall apply to the Commission for approval of that agreement under this subsection. The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy of section 10101a of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of its approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1, et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12, et seq.), the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41, et seq.), sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9), and the Act of June 19, 1936, as amended (15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, 13b, 21a) do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement. However, the Commission may not approve or continue approval of an agreement when the conditions required by it are not met or if it does not receive a verified statement under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission may approve an agreement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only when the carriers applying for approval file a verified statement with the Commission. Each statement must specify for each rail carrier that is a party to the agreement&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the name of the carrier;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the mailing address and telephone number of its headquarter's office; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the names of each of its affiliates and the names, addresses, and affiliates of each of its officers and directors and of each person, together with an affiliate, owning or controlling any debt, equity, or security interest in it having a value of at least $1,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection shall make a final disposition of a rule or rate docketed with it by the 120th day after the proposal is docketed. Such an organization may not&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) permit a rail carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on single line rates proposed by another rail carrier, except that for purposes of general rate increases and broad tariff changes only, if the Commission finds at any time that the implementation of this clause is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) permit a rail carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on rates related to a particular interline movement unless that rail carrier practicably participates in that movement; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) if there are interline movements over two or more routes between the same end points, permit a carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on rates except with a carrier which forms part of a particular single route. This clause shall take effect on January 1, 1984, or on such earlier date as the Commission determines. If the Commission finds at any time that the implementation of this clause is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Until January 1, 1984, subparagraph (A)(ii) and (A)(iii) of this paragraph do not apply to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) general rate increases to cover inflationary cost increases, or general rate decreases, for joint rates if the agreement gives shippers, under specified procedures, at least 15 days notice of the proposal and an opportunity to present comments on it before a tariff containing the increases or decreases is filed with the Commission; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) broad tariff changes that are of at least substantially general application throughout the area where the changes will apply, except single line rates where subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph prohibits the participation of carriers with single line rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Commission finds at any time that the implementation of this subparagraph is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In any proceeding in which a party alleges that a rail carrier voted or agreed on a rate or allowance in violation of this subsection, that party has the burden of showing that the vote or agreement occurred. A showing of parallel behavior does not satisfy that burden by itself.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In any proceeding in which it is alleged that a carrier was a party to an agreement, conspiracy, or combination in violation of a Federal law cited in subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section or of any similar State law, proof of an agreement, conspiracy, or combination may not be inferred from evidence that two or more carriers acted together with respect to an interline rate or related matter and that a party to such action took similar action with respect to a rate or related matter on another route or traffic. In any proceeding in which such a violation is alleged, evidence of a discussion or agreement between or among such carrier and one or more other carriers, or of any rate or other action resulting from such discussion or agreement, shall not be admissible if the discussion or agreement&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) was in accordance with an agreement approved under paragraph (2) of this subsection; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) concerned an interline movement of the carrier, and the discussion or agreement would not, considered by itself, violate the laws referred to in the first sentence of this clause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In any proceeding before a jury, the court shall determine whether the requirements of clause (I) or (II) are satisfied before allowing the introduction of any such evidence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) An organization described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall provide that transcripts or sound recordings be made of all meetings, that records of votes be made, and that such transcripts or recordings and voting records be submitted to the Commission and made available to other Federal agencies in connection with their statutory responsibilities over rate bureaus, except that such material shall be kept confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United States Code.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, one or more rail carriers may enter into an agreement, without obtaining prior Commission approval, that provides solely for compilation, publication, and other distribution of rates in effect or to become effective. The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.), sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9), and the Act of June 19, 1936, as amended (15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, 13b, 21a) shall not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out such agreement. However, the Commission may, upon application or on its own initiative, investigate whether the parties to such an agreement have exceeded its scope, and upon a finding that they have, the Commission may issue such orders as are necessary, including an order dissolving the agreement, to ensure that actions taken pursuant to the agreement are limited as provided in this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Whenever two or more shippers enter into an agreement to discuss among themselves that relates to the amount of compensation such shippers propose to be paid by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, for use by such rail carriers of rolling stock owned or leased by such shippers, the shippers shall apply to the Commission for approval of that agreement under this paragraph. The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy set forth in section 10101a of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the terms required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement. The Commission shall approve or disapprove an agreement under this paragraph within one year after the date application for approval of such agreement is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission approves an agreement described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the shippers entering into such agreement and the rail carriers proposing to use rolling stock owned or leased by such shippers, under payment by such carriers or under a published allowance, are unable to agree upon the amount of compensation to be paid for the use of such rolling stock, any party directly involved in the negotiations may require that the matter be settled by submitting the issues in dispute to the Commission. The Commission shall render a binding decision, based upon a standard of reasonableness and after taking into consideration any past precedents on the subject matter of the negotiations, no later than 90 days after the date of the submission of the dispute to the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the law in effect prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 with respect to the obligation of rail carriers to utilize rolling stock owned or leased by shippers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In this subsection, &#8220;single-line rate&#8221; refers to a rate, charge, or allowance proposed by a single motor common carrier that is applicable only over its line and for which the transportation can be provided by that carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) As provided by this subsection, a motor common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may enter into an agreement with one or more such carriers concerning rates (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), allowances, classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, or establishment of them. Such agreement may be submitted to the Commission for approval by any carrier or carriers which are parties to such agreement and shall be approved by the Commission upon a finding that the agreement fulfills each requirement of this subsection, unless the Commission finds that such agreement is inconsistent with the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title. The Commission may require compliance with reasonable conditions consistent with this subtitle to assure that the agreement furthers such transportation policy. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Agreements submitted to the Commission under this subsection may be approved by the Commission only if each of the following conditions are met:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each carrier which is a party to an agreement must file with the Commission a verified statement that specifies its name, mailing address, and telephone number of its main office; the names of each of its affiliates; the names, addresses, and affiliates of each of its officers and directors; the names, addresses, and affiliates of each person, together with an affiliate, owning or controlling any debt, equity, or security interest in it having a value of at least $1,000,000. In this subparagraph, &#8220;affiliate&#8221; means a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control or ownership with another person and &#8220;ownership&#8221; means equity holdings in a business entity of at least 5 percent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection must comply with the following requirements:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this paragraph, (I) the organization may allow any member carrier to discuss any rate proposal docketed, but (II) after January 1, 1981, only those carriers with authority to participate in the transportation to which the rate proposal applies may vote upon such rate proposal;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the organization may not interfere with each carrier's right of independent action and may not change or cancel any rate established by independent action after the date of enactment of this subsection, other than a general increase or broad rate restructuring, except that changes in such rates may be effected, with the consent of the carrier or carriers that initiated the independent action, for the purpose of tariff simplification, removal of discrimination, or elimination of obsolete items;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the organization may not file a protest or complaint with the Commission against any tariff item published by or for the account of any motor carrier;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the organization may not permit one of its employees or any employee committee to docket or act upon any proposal effecting a change in any tariff item published by or for the account of any of its member carriers;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) upon request, the organization must divulge to any person the name of the proponent of a rule or rate docketed with it, must admit any person to any meeting at which rates or rules will be discussed or voted upon, and must divulge to any person the vote cast by any member carrier on any proposal before the organization;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) the organization may not allow a carrier to vote for one or more other carriers without specific written authority from the carrier being represented; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) the organization shall make a final disposition of a rule or rate docketed with it by the 120th day after the proposal is docketed, except that if unusual circumstances require, the organization may extend such period, subject to review by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) No agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting on rates to which the provisions of section 10708(d) or 10730(b) of this title apply, except that rates established or filed under section 10730 of this title before the date of enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 or changes with respect to such rates may be discussed or voted on under agreements approved under this subsection until January 1, 1984.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) No agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon single-line rates on or after January 1, 1984, except that such date shall be July 1, 1984, if the Motor Carrier Ratemaking Study Commission does not submit its final report under section 14(b)(4) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 on or before January 1, 1983. This subparagraph shall not apply to any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. This subparagraph and subparagraph (B)(i)(II) of this paragraph shall not apply to the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) general rate increases or decreases if the agreement gives shippers, under specified procedures, at least 15 days&#8217; notice of the proposal and an opportunity to present comments on it before a tariff containing the increases or decreases is filed with the Commission and if discussion of such increases or decreases is limited to industry average carrier costs and, after the date of elimination of the antitrust immunity by this subparagraph, does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) changes in commodity classifications;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) changes in tariff structures if discussion of such changes is limited to industry average carrier costs and, after the date of elimination of antitrust immunity by this subparagraph, does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) publishing of tariffs, filing of independent actions for individual members carriers, providing of support services for members, and changes in rules or regulations which are of at least substantially general application throughout the area in which such changes will apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) On and after January 1, 1983, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. On and after January 1, 1984, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any joint rate proposed by one or more motor common carriers of passengers. This subparagraph shall not apply to any rate applicable to special or charter transportation. This subparagraph and subparagraph (B)(i)(II) of this paragraph shall not apply to the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any general rate increase or decrease, broad change in tariff structure, or promotional or innovative fare change, as defined by the Commission and subject to such notice requirements as the Commission may specify by regulation, if discussion of such general increase or decrease is limited to industry average carrier costs and intermodal competitive factors and does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates or joint rates; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) publishing of tariffs, filing of independent actions for individual member carriers, providing of support services for members, and changes in rules or regulations which are of at least substantially general application throughout the area in which such changes will apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) After the effective date of this subparagraph, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any rate applicable to special or charter transportation proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. This subparagraph shall not apply to publication of any such rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) In any proceeding in which a party to such proceeding alleges that a carrier voted, discussed, or agreed on a rate or allowance in violation of this subsection, that party has the burden of showing that the vote, discussion, or agreement occurred. A showing of parallel behavior does not satisfy that burden by itself.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) The Commission shall, by regulation, determine reasonable quorum standards to be applied for meetings of organizations established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, before the date on which the antitrust immunity is eliminated for discussion of or voting on single-line rates by paragraph (3)(D) of this subsection, the Commission may not take any action which would, on the basis of the type of carrier service involved (including service by carriers singly or in combination with other carriers), result in the exclusion of one or more motor common carriers of property from discussion or voting under agreements authorized by this subsection on matters concerning rates, allowances, classifications, or divisions, except that before such date, the Commission may issue regulations which take effect on or after such date to carry out the provisions of such paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle (other than paragraph (3)(F) of this subsection, relating to special and charter transportation of passengers), before January 1, 1983, the Commission may not take any action which would, on the basis of the type of carrier service involved (including service by carriers singly or in combination with other carriers), result in the exclusion of one or more motor common carriers of passengers from discussion or voting under agreements authorized by this subsection on matters concerning rates, allowances, or divisions, except that before January 1, 1983, the Commission may issue regulations which take effect on or after January 1, 1983, to carry out the provisions of paragraph (3)(E) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title (except a rail carrier or a motor common carrier) that is a party to an agreement of at least 2 carriers related to rates (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), allowances, classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, or establishment of them, may apply to the Commission for approval of that agreement under this subsection. The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In this subsection, carriers are classified as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Rail, express, and sleeping car carriers are a class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Pipeline carriers are a class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Motor carriers are a class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Water carriers are a class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Household goods freight forwarders are a class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may not approve an agreement under this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) between or among carriers of different classes unless, in addition to the finding required under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the Commission finds that the agreement is limited to matters related to transportation under joint rates or over through routes;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) related to a pooling, division, or other matter to which subchapter III of chapter 113 of this title applies; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) establishing a procedure for determination of a matter through joint consideration unless the Commission finds that each party to the agreement has the absolute right under it to take independent action before or after a determination is made under that procedure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may require an organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this section to maintain records and submit reports. The Commission, or its delegate, may inspect a record maintained under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may review an agreement approved under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section and shall change the conditions of approval or terminate it when necessary to comply with (1) the public interest and subsection (a), or (2) subsection (b) or (c). The Commission shall postpone the effective date of a change of an agreement under this subsection for whatever period it determines to be reasonably necessary to avoid unreasonably hardship.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application. Action of the Commission under this section (1) approving an agreement, (2) denying, ending, or changing approval, (3) prescribing the conditions on which approval is granted, or (4) changing those conditions, has effect only as related to application of the antitrust laws referred to in subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Commission shall review each agreement approved under subsection (a) of this section periodically, but at least once every 3 years (1) to determine whether the agreement or an organization established or continued under one of those agreements still complies with the requirements of that subsection and the public interest, and (2) to evaluate the success and effect of that agreement or organization on the consuming public and the national rail freight transportation system. If the Commission finds that an agreement or organization does not conform to the requirements of that subsection, it shall end or suspend its approval. The Commission shall report to the President and Congress the results of the review as a part of its annual report under section 10311 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, shall prepare periodically an assessment of, and shall report to the Commission on&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) possible anticompetitive features of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) agreements approved or submitted for approval under subsection (a) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an organization operating under those agreements; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) possible ways to alleviate or end an anticompetitive feature, effect, or aspect in a manner that will further the goals of this subtitle and of the transportation policy of section 10101a of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Reports received by the Commission under this subsection shall be published and made available to the public under section 552(a) of title 5.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10707 &#183; Investigation and suspension of new rail carrier rates, classifications, rules, and practices</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a new individual or joint rate or individual or joint classification, rule, or practice related to a rate is filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, the Commission may begin a proceeding, on its own initiative or on complaint of an interested party, to determine whether the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice violates this subtitle. The Commission must give reasonable notice to interested parties before beginning a proceeding under this subsection but may act without allowing an interested party to file an answer or other formal pleading in response to its decision to begin the proceeding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission must complete a proceeding under this section and make its final decision by the end of the 5th month after the rate, classification, rule, or practice was to become effective, except that if the Commission reports to the Congress by the end of such 5th month that it cannot make a final decision by that time and explains the reason for the delay, it may take an additional 3 months to complete the proceeding and make its final decision. If the Commission does not reach a final decision within the applicable time period, the rate, classification, rule, or practice&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is effective at the end of that time period; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if already in effect at the end of that time period, remains in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an interested party has filed a complaint under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may set aside a rate, classification, rule, or practice, that has become effective under this section if the Commission finds it to be in violation of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may not suspend a proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice during the course of a Commission proceeding under this section unless it appears from the specific facts shown by the verified statement of a person that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is substantially likely that the protestant will prevail on the merits;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without suspension, the proposed rate change will cause substantial injury to the protestant or the party represented by the protestant; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) because of the peculiar economic circumstances of the protestant, the provisions of subsection (d) of this section do not protect the protestant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The burden shall be on the protestant to prove the matters described in paragraph (1)(A), (B), and (C) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If the Commission does not suspend a proposed rate increase under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall require the rail carrier to account for all amounts received under the increase until the Commission completes its proceedings under subsection (b) of this section. The accounting shall specify by whom and for whom the amounts are paid. When the Commission takes final action, it shall require the carrier to refund to the person for whom the amounts were paid that part of the increased rate found to be unreasonable, plus interest at a rate equal to the average yield (on the date the statement is filed) of marketable securities of the United States Government having a duration of 90 days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a rate is suspended under subsection (c) of this section and any portion of such rate is later found to be reasonable under this subtitle, the carrier shall collect from each person using the transportation to which the rate applies the difference between the original rate and the portion of the suspended rate found to be reasonable for any services performed during the period of suspension, plus interest at a rate equal to the average yield (on the date the statement is filed) of marketable securities of the United States Government having a duration of 90 days, except that this paragraph shall not apply to general rate increases under section 10706 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any portion of a proposed rate decrease is suspended under subsection (c) of this section and later found to be reasonable under this subtitle, the rail carrier may refund any part of the portion of the decrease found to comply with this subtitle if the carrier makes the refund available to each shipper who participated in the rate, in accordance with the relative amount of such shipper's traffic transported at such rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10741 or section 10761 of this title, the Commission shall, by rule, establish standards and procedures permitting a rail carrier to waive the collection of amounts due under this subsection if such amounts are not significant.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10707a &#183; Zone of rail carrier rate flexibility</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) &#8220;base rate&#8221; means, with respect to the transportation of a particular commodity (i) for the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 1980, the rate in effect on October 1, 1980, (ii) for the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 1982, the rate in effect on October 1, 1982, and (iii) for the 5-year period beginning on October 1, 1984, and for each subsequent 5-year period, the rate in effect on the first day of the applicable 5-year period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If no rate exists for the transportation of a particular commodity on October 1, 1980, the base rate for the transportation of such commodity shall be the rate established by the rail carrier (divided by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission), unless such rate is found to be unreasonable by the Commission, in which case the base rate shall be the rate authorized by the Commission (divided by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) &#8220;adjusted base rate&#8221; means the base rate for the transportation of a particular commodity multiplied by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Commencing with the fourth quarter of 1980, the Commission shall, as often as practicable but in no event less often than quarterly, publish a rail cost adjustment factor which shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the latest published Index of Railroad Costs (which index shall be compiled or verified by the Commission, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the changing composition of railroad costs, including the quality and mix of material and labor), and the denominator of which is the same index for the fourth quarter of 1980, or for the fourth quarter of 1982 or for the fourth quarter of every fifth year thereafter, as appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title so long as the increased rate is not greater than the adjusted base rate for the transportation involved, plus any rate increases implemented under subsection (c) or (d) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rate increase authorized under this subsection may not be found to exceed a reasonable maximum for the transportation involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rail carrier may not increase a rate under this subsection to the extent that the cost increases to such carrier due to inflation are recovered through (A) general rate increases pursuant to section 10706 of this title, or (B) inflation-based rate increases under section 10712 of this title applicable to that rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) During the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and during each of the 3 succeeding 12-month periods, a rail carrier may, in addition to rate increases authorized under subsection (b) of this section, increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title by an annual amount of not more than 6 percent of the adjusted base rate, except that in no event shall the total increase under this subsection result in a rate which is more than 118 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If any portion of a rate increase under this subsection is not implemented in the year in which it is authorized, such portion may, except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, be implemented only in the next succeeding year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If any portion of the total rate increase authorized under this subsection is not implemented by the end of the 4-year period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, such portion may be implemented in the next 2 succeeding years, except that in no event may a rail carrier increase a rate under this subsection or under subsection (d) of this section in either of such 2 succeeding years by an annual amount of more than 10 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, and during each succeeding 12-month period, a rail carrier may, in addition to rate increases under subsection (b) of this section, increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title by an annual amount of not more than 4 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No portion of any rate increase under this subsection which is not implemented in the year in which it is authorized may be implemented in any other year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a rail carrier proposing to increase a single line rate if such carrier earns adequate revenues, as determined by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall, after a hearing on the record, prescribe such rules with respect to joint rates as necessary to ensure that rail carriers which earn adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, do not receive the rate increases authorized by this subsection unless the Commission determines that it is unable to prescribe such rules without precluding rail carriers not earning adequate revenues from receiving the rate increases authorized under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10707 of this title, in the case of any rate increase by a rail carrier that is authorized under subsection (c) or (d) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the Commission may not suspend such rate increase pending final Commission action; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission may not begin an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title with respect to the reasonableness of such rate increase; but</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an interested party may file a complaint under section 11701(b) of this title alleging that such rate increase violates the provisions of this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In considering any complaint challenging a rate increase that is authorized under subsection (c) of this section and that results in a revenue-variable cost percentage that is less than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(A), the Commission shall, in determining the reasonableness of such rate increase, give due consideration to whether the carrier proposing the rate increase has attained adequate revenues, as determined by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, giving regard to preventing a carrier with adequate revenues from realizing excessive profits on the traffic involved and also the policy of bringing to an adequate level the revenues of carriers not having an adequate revenue level.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If a rate increase authorized under this section in any year results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 20 percentage points above the revenue-variable cost percentage applicable in that year under section 10709(d) of this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a revenue-variable cost percentage of 190 percent,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is less, the Commission may, on its own initiative, or on complaint of an interested party, begin an investigation proceeding to determine whether the proposed rate increase violates this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining whether to investigate or not to investigate any proposed rate increase that results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (without regard to whether such rate increase is authorized under this section), the Commission shall set forth its reasons therefor, giving due consideration to the following factors:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and efforts made to minimize such traffic;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the impact of the proposed rate or rate increase on the attainment of the national energy goals and the rail transportation policy under section 10101a of this title, taking into account the railroads&#8217; role as a primary source of energy transportation and the need for a sound rail transportation system in accordance with the revenue adequacy goals of section 10704 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">This subparagraph shall not be construed to change existing law with regard to the nonreviewability of such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In determining whether a rate is reasonable, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and efforts made to minimize such traffic;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the carrier's mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier's overall revenues.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) In any proceeding under this section, evidence of the underlying rail carrier rate is admissible.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) A finding by the Commission that a rate increase exceeds the increase authorized under this section does not establish a presumption that (1) the rail carrier proposing such rate increase has or does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, or (2) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) The authority of the Commission to determine and prescribe reasonable rules, classifications, and practices may not be used, directly or indirectly, to limit the rates which rail carriers are otherwise authorized to establish under this subtitle.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10708 &#183; Investigation and suspension of new nonrail carrier rates, classifications, rules, and practices</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to determine the lawfulness of a proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice immediately, on its own initiative or on application of an interested party when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a new individual or joint rate or individual or joint classification, rule, or practice affecting a rate is filed with the Commission by a common carrier, other than a rail carrier, under this subtitle; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a new or reduced rate or rule or practice that causes a reduction of a rate is filed with the Commission by a contract carrier under this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission must give reasonable notice before beginning a proceeding under this section but may act without allowing an interested carrier to file an answer or other formal pleading in response to its decision to begin the proceeding. The Commission may take whatever final action on a rate, classification, rule, or practice under this section, after a full hearing (whether completed before or after the rate, classification, rule, or practices goes into effect), as it could in a proceeding begun after a rate, &#255;7E&#255;7Eclassification, &#255;7E&#255;7Erule, &#255;7E&#255;7Eor &#255;7E&#255;7Epractice &#255;7E&#255;7Ebecame effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Pending final Commission action in a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may suspend the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice at any time for not more than 7 months beyond the time it would otherwise go into effect by (1) delivering to each affected carrier, and (2) filing with the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice, a statement of reasons for the suspension. If the Commission does not take final action during the suspension period, the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice is effective at the end of that period. However, if an increase in a rate for, or related to, transportation of property by an express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier becomes effective under this subsection, the Commission may require the interested carrier to account for all amounts received under it and specify by whom and on whose behalf those amounts were paid. When the Commission takes final action, it may require the carrier to refund, with interest, to the persons on whose behalf those amounts were paid, the part of the increased rate found to be in violation of this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) In a proceeding under this section, the burden is on the carrier proposing the changed rate, classification, rule, or practice to prove that the change is reasonable. The Commission shall give proceedings under this section preference over all other proceedings related to that type of carrier pending before it and make its decision at the earliest practical time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of property or household goods freight forwarder on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier notifies the Commission that it wishes to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 10 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on July 1, 1980 (or, in the case of any rate which a carrier first establishes after July 1, 1980, for a service not provided by such carrier on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, may increase the percentages specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection for any group of motor common carriers of property or household goods freight forwarders if it finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is sufficient actual and potential competition to regulate rates; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there are benefits to (i) carriers or household goods freight forwarders, (ii) shippers, and (iii) the public from further rate flexibility;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Commission may not increase such percentages by more than 5 percentage points during any one-year period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In determining, pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, whether the aggregate of increases and decreases in a proposed rate that is to take effect on or before the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph is more than 10 percent (or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection) above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, general rate increases obtained in the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate shall not be included in such aggregate, except to the extent that such general rate increases exceed 5 percent of the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a proposed rate that is to take effect after the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph, the percentage which first appears in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection (relating to the upper limit of the zone of ratemaking freedom), or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection in lieu of such percentage, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the percentage change in the Producers Price Index, as published by the Department of Labor, that has occurred during the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers, or joint rate proposed by one or more such carriers, applicable to any transportation (other than special or charter transportation) on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier or carriers notify the Commission that they wish to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 20 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on the effective date of this paragraph (or, in case of any rate which the carrier or carriers first establish after such date for a service not provided by the carrier or carriers on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) One year after the effective date of this paragraph, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Two years after the effective date, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any rate implemented by a carrier pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), except that the docketing and publication of such rate by the carrier under section 10706(b) of this title shall not be construed as a violation of the antitrust laws. Evidence that any motor common carrier of passengers established pursuant to this subsection a joint or single-line rate applicable to transportation over any route which is the same as or similar to a joint rate applicable to transportation over such route which such carrier together with one or more other motor common carriers of passengers established pursuant to this subsection shall not be in and of itself sufficient to establish a violation of any such antitrust law. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates on the basis that such rates may violate the provisions of section 10741 of this title or constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, 3 years after the effective date of this subsection, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low, unless the proposed rate is established collectively in accordance with the procedures of an agreement approved by the Commission under section 10706(b) of this title. In publishing and filing a tariff under section 10762 of this title, the carrier shall disclose whether such rate is the result of collective ratemaking procedures pursuant to an agreement approved by the Commission under section 10706(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an interested party may file a complaint under section 11701 of this title challenging the reasonableness of a rate filed under this section by a motor carrier of passengers. Any such complaint proceeding shall be finally determined by the Commission no later than 90 days after the filing of the complaint.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers applicable to special or charter transportation. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates on the basis that such rates constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10709 &#183; Determination of market dominance in rail carrier rate proceedings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, &#8220;market dominance&#8221; means an absence of effective competition from other carriers or modes of transportation for the transportation to which a rate applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title is challenged as being unreasonably high, the Commission shall determine, within 90 days after the start of a proceeding under section 10707 of this title to investigate the lawfulness of that rate, whether the carrier proposing the rate has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies. The Commission may make that determination on its own initiative or on complaint. A finding by the Commission that the carrier does not have market dominance is determinative in a proceeding under this subtitle related to that rate or transportation unless changed or set aside by the Commission or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the Commission finds in any proceeding that a rail carrier proposing or defending a rate for transportation has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, it may then determine that rate to be unreasonable if it exceeds a reasonable maximum for that transportation. However, a finding of market dominance does not establish a presumption that the proposed rate exceeds a reasonable maximum. This subsection does not limit the power of the Commission to suspend a rate under section 10707(c) of this title. However, if the Commission has found that a carrier does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, the Commission may suspend an increase in that rate as being in excess of a reasonable maximum for that transportation only if it specifically changes or sets aside its prior determination of market dominance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In this subsection&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &#8220;fixed and variable cost&#8221; means all cost incurred by rail carriers in the transportation of freight, but limiting the return on equity capital to a rate equal to the embedded cost of debt.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) &#8220;cost recovery percentage&#8221; means the lowest revenue-variable cost percentage which, if all movements that produced revenues resulting in revenue-variable cost percentages in excess of the cost recovery percentage are deemed to have produced only revenues resulting in the cost recovery percentage, would produce revenues which would be equal, when combined with total revenues produced by all other traffic transported by rail carrier, to the total fixed and variable cost of the transportation of all traffic by rail carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for purposes of determining the cost recovery percentage only, &#8220;revenue-variable cost percentage&#8221; means the quotient, expressed as a percentage figure, obtained by dividing the total revenues produced by the transportation of all traffic received by rail carriers for rail transportation by the total variable cost of such transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a determination under this section, the Commission shall find that the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies if such rail carrier proves that the rate charged results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for such transportation that is less than&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 160 percent during the period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and ending September 30, 1981;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 165 percent during the period beginning October 1, 1981, and ending September 30, 1982;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 170 percent during the period beginning October 1, 1982, and ending September 30, 1983;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 175 percent or the cost recovery percentage, whichever is less, during the period beginning October 1, 1983, and ending September 30, 1984; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cost recovery percentage, during each 12-month period beginning on or after October 1, 1984.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph, the cost recovery percentage shall in no event be less than a revenue-variable cost percentage of 170 percent or more than a revenue-variable cost percentage of 180 percent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of determining the revenue-variable cost percentage for a particular transportation, variable costs shall be determined pursuant to section 10705a(m)(1) of this title, with adjustments specified by the Commission. A rail carrier may meet its burden of proof under this subsection by establishing its variable costs in accordance with such section 10705a(m)(1), but a shipper may rebut that showing by evidence of such type, and in accordance with such burden of proof, as the Commission shall prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A finding by the Commission that a rate charged by a rail carrier results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the applicable percentage under paragraph (2) of this subsection does not establish a presumption that (A) such rail carrier has or does not have market dominance over such transportation, or (B) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and on an annual basis thereafter, the Commission shall determine the cost recovery percentage for the transportation of all traffic received by rail carriers. The Commission shall make such determination after considering each individual revenue-variable cost percentage resulting from the revenues and costs of a valid and reliable statistical sample of all movements of commodities transported by class I rail carriers during the most recent calendar year for which such information is available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, on the basis of calculations under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission determines that revenues earned by all class I rail carriers during the previous calendar year do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of such carriers, then the cost recovery percentage for purposes of this section shall be deemed to be equal to the cost recovery percentage last determined by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall, in its annual report submitted to the Congress under section 10311 of this title, set forth the cost recovery percentage determined for that year under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) One or more rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may enter into a contract with one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified services under specified rates and conditions. Such a rail carrier may not enter into a contract with purchasers of rail service except as provided in this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Each contract entered into under this section shall be filed with the Commission, together with a summary of the contract containing such nonconfidential information as the Commission prescribes. The Commission shall publish special tariff rules for such contracts in order to assure that the essential terms of the contract are available to the general public in tariff format.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The essential terms of any contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities to be made available to the general public in tariff format under this subsection shall include, but shall not be limited to (i) the identity of the shipper party to the contract; (ii) the specific origins, transit points and other shipper facilities subject to the contract, and destinations served under such contract; (iii) the duration of the contract, including provisions for optional extension; (iv) the actual volume requirements, if any; (v) whether any transportation service has begun under a contract before the date such contract is filed with or approved by the Commission, and (vi) the date on which the contract became applicable to the transportation services provided under the contract. The Commission shall interpret this subsection to provide for liberal discovery to shippers seeking remedies under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amendment, supplement, or change to any term or provision of any contract described in subparagraph (A), including extensions of such contract, changes of origin, transit points, affected shipper facilities, destination points, or negotiated economic terms, shall be deemed to be a separate and new contract for the purposes of this subsection. Such amendments, supplements, or changes shall be filed separately with the Commission as provided in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Within 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act, the Commission shall issue regulations which require that essential terms of contracts described in subparagraph (A) shall be made available to the general public in tariff format as provided in this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The railroad contract rate advisory service established pursuant to subsection (m) of this section shall assess the impact on competition among agricultural shippers of variations between contract rates for various shipments and the published single car rates, and shall submit a report to the Congress not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A contract filed under this section shall be approved by the Commission, as provided in subsection (e) of this section, unless the Commission determines in a proceeding under subsection (d) of this section that such contract is in violation of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) No later than 30 days after the date of filing of a contract under this section, the Commission may, on its own initiative or on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such contract on the grounds described in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a contract other than a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), a complaint may be filed&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by a shipper only on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because the proposed contract unduly impairs the ability of the contracting carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier obligations to the complainant under section 11101 of this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by a port only on the grounds that such port individually will be harmed because the proposed contract will result in unreasonable discrimination against such port.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), in addition to the grounds for a complaint described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a complaint may be filed by a shipper on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract at issue, and that shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the proposed contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice under this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the Commission shall consider the difference between contract rates and published single car rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &#8220;unreasonable discrimination&#8221; has the same meaning as such term has under section 10741 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter II&#8212;Special Circumstances</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10721 &#183; Government traffic</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in this section, the full applicable commercial rate shall be paid for transportation for the United States Government by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under this subtitle. Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) does not apply when transportation for the United States Government can be obtained from a common carrier lawfully operating in the area where the transportation will be provided. When prescribing rates for transportation or service by those common carriers, the Commission shall consider increased revenues those carriers receive under this subsection to reflect those increases in appropriate readjustments of their rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply, and the law related to compensation for transportation for the United States Government in effect immediately before September 18, 1940, applies to a rail carrier if that carrier, or its predecessor in interest, received a grant of land from the United States to aid in constructing the railroad it operates but did not file a release with the Secretary of the Interior before September 18, 1941, of claims against the United States Government to, or arising out of, lands that were granted, claimed to have been granted, or claimed should have been granted to that carrier or its predecessor in interest. This paragraph does not require a rail carrier to reconvey to the United States land patented or certified to it or prevent the patent of land that the Secretary of the Interior found was sold by the carrier to an innocent purchaser for value or as preventing the patent of land listed or selected by the carrier and finally approved by the Secretary of the Interior to the extent that issuance of those patents is authorized by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may transport individuals for the United States Government without charge or at reduced rates. The carriers may transport custom inspectors and immigration officers without charge. A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall provide transportation for the United States Postal Service under chapters 50 and 52 of title 39, and may transport property for the United States Government, a State, or municipal government without charge or at reduced rates; except that any rates for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government shall not be predatory.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unless a carrier is advised by the United States Government that disclosure of a quotation or tender of a rate established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for transportation provided to the United States Government would endanger the national security, the carrier shall file the quoted or tendered rate, including a retroactive rate made after the transportation has been provided, concurrently, with the Commission and the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government for which the quotation or tender was made or for which the proposed transportation is to be provided. A carrier may quote or tender a rate established under an agreement made and approved under section 10706 of this title, but the exemption from the antitrust laws provided by that section applies only when the filing requirements of this paragraph are met.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government on the basis that such rates constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title. However, pending final Commission action in a proceeding under section 10708 of this title to determine whether a proposed rate for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government under this subsection is predatory or not, the Commission may suspend the proposed rate under subsection (b) of such section 10708 only if it appears from specific facts shown by the verified complaint of a person that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) without suspension, the proposed rate will cause substantial injury to the complainant; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is likely that the complainant will prevail on the merits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A different policy, rule of rate making, system of accounting, method of determining costs of transportation, value of property, or rate of return may not be applied to a water carrier owned or controlled by the United States Government than is applied to a water carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title.</p>

A carrier that establishes a rate under this subsection may issue tickets reflecting that rate. A carrier that establishes a joint interchangeable 5,000 mile passenger rate shall also establish rules related to that rate specifying the amount of baggage that may be carried without charge under it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &#8220;family&#8221; refers to the family of an individual named in clause (A) of this paragraph and includes the surviving spouse or minor child of an employee who died while employed by a carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may provide transportation without charge for officers and employees (and their families) of that carrier, another carrier (by exchange of passes or tickets), or a telegraph, telephone, or cable company. A household goods freight forwarder providing service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter IV of that chapter may provide services related to movement of property for those individuals without charge. However, transportation of, or service provided for, household goods must be due to a change in the place of employment of an officer or employee while employed by that carrier.</p>

A rate may be made applicable under this section to livestock only if the livestock is valuable chiefly for breeding, racing, show purposes, or other special uses. A tariff filed with the Commission by a household goods freight forwarder under subchapter IV of this chapter shall refer specifically to the action of the Commission under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before a carrier or freight forwarder may establish a rate for any service under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission may require such carrier or freight forwarder to have in effect and keep in effect, during any period such rate is in effect under such paragraph, a rate for such service which does not limit the liability of the carrier or freight forwarder.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may establish rates for transportation of property under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written declaration of the shipper or by a written agreement between the shipper and the carrier, and may provide in such written declaration or agreement for specified amounts to be deducted from any claim against the carrier for loss or damage to the property or for delay in the transportation of such property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not charge or receive from a person a different compensation (by using a special rate, rebate, drawback, or another means) for a service rendered, or to be rendered, in transportation the carrier may perform under this subtitle than it charges or receives from another person for performing a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances. A common carrier that charges or receives such a different compensation for that service unreasonably discriminates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic to unreasonable discrimination. However, subject to subsection (c) of this section, this subsection does not apply to discrimination against the traffic of another carrier providing transportation by any mode.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of that chapter may not subject a household goods freight forwarder providing service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter IV of that chapter to unreasonable discrimination whether or not the household goods freight forwarder is controlled by that carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Differences between the rates, classifications, rules, and practices of water and rail common carriers in effect for their respective types of transportation do not constitute a violation of this section or an unfair or destructive competitive practice under this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Differences between rates, classifications, rules, and practices of rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title do not constitute a violation of this section if such differences result from different services provided by rail carriers.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10744 &#183; Liability for payment of rates</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail, motor, or water common carrier under this subtitle. When the shipper or consignor instructs the carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the consignee is liable only for rates billed at the time of delivery under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner, is liable for those additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the carrier, and a reconsignor or diverter giving a rail carrier, erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor, named in the bill of lading as consignee, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail or express carrier under this subtitle. When the shipper or consignor gives written notice, before delivery of the property, to the line-haul carrier that is to make ultimate delivery&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to deliver the property to another party identified by the shipper or consignor as the beneficial owner of the property; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that delivery is to be made to that party on payment of all applicable transportation rates;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">that party is liable for the rates billed at the time of delivery and for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if that party does not pay the rates required to be paid under clause (2) of this subsection on delivery. However, if the party gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery that the party is not the beneficial owner of the property and gives the carrier the name and address of the beneficial owner, then the party is not liable for those additional rates. A shipper, consignor, or party to whom delivery is made that gives the delivering carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner, is liable for the additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. This subsection does not apply to a prepaid shipment of property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A rail carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11706(a) of this title or by the end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the consignee, or the beneficial owner named by the consignee or agent, under that section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A water common carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That carrier must bring the action by the end of the 2d year after the claim accrues or by end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the consignee or beneficial owner named by the consignee by the end of that 2-year period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rail or express carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (b) of this section. That carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11706(a) of this title or by the end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the shipper, consignor, or other party under that section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not enter a combination or arrangement to prevent the carriage of freight from being continuous from the place of shipment to the place of destination whether by change of time schedule, carriage in different cars, or by other means. The carriage of freight by those carriers is considered to be a continuous carriage from the place of shipment to the place of destination when a break of bulk, stoppage, or interruption is not made in good faith for a necessary purpose, and with the intent of avoiding or unnecessarily interrupting the continuous carriage or of evading this subtitle.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10762 &#183; General tariff requirements</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title (except a motor common carrier) shall publish and file with the Commission tariffs containing the rates and (A) if a common carrier, classifications, rules, and practices related to those rates, and (B) if a contract carrier, rules and practices related to those rates, established under this chapter for transportation or service it may provide under this subtitle. A motor common carrier (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property, other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice, as defined in section 10102(13), or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall publish and file with the Commission tariffs containing the rates for transportation it may provide under this subtitle. The Commission may prescribe other information that motor common carriers (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property, other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice, as defined in section 10102(13), or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall include in their tariffs. A motor contract carrier of property is not required to publish or file actual or minimum rates under this subtitle. Except as provided in the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 and the amendments made by that Act, nothing in the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 (and the amendments made by that Act) creates any obligation for a shipper based solely on a rate that was on file with the Commission or elsewhere on the date of enactment of such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Carriers that publish tariffs under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall keep them open for public inspection. A rate contained in a tariff filed by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 shall be stated in money of the United States. A tariff filed by a motor or water contract carrier or by a household goods freight forwarder providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of that chapter, respectively, may not become effective for 30 days after it is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A motor common carrier of property (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall provide to the shipper, on request of the shipper, a written or electronic copy of the rate, classification, rules, and practices, upon which any rate agreed to between the shipper and carrier may have been based. When the applicability or reasonableness of the rates and related provisions billed by a motor common carrier is challenged by the person paying the freight charges, the Commission shall determine whether such rates and provisions are reasonable or applicable based on the record before it. In those cases where a motor common carrier (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) seeks to collect charges in addition to those billed and collected which are contested by the payor, the carrier may request that the Commission determine whether any additional charges over those billed and collected must be paid. A carrier must issue any bill for charges in addition to those originally billed within 180 days of the original bill in order to have the right to collect such charges.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a shipper seeks to contest the charges originally billed, the shipper may request that the Commission determine whether the charges originally billed must be paid. A shipper must contest the original bill within 180 days in order to have the right to contest such charges.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any tariff on file with the Commission on the date of enactment of the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 not required to be filed with the Commission after the enactment of that Act is null and void beginning on that date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall prescribe the form and manner of publishing, filing, and keeping tariffs open for public inspection under this section. The Commission may prescribe specific charges to be identified in a tariff published by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I, III, or IV of that chapter, but those tariffs must identify plainly&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the places between which property and passengers will be transported;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) terminal, storage, and icing charges (stated separately) if a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) terminal charges if a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III or IV of that chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) privileges given and facilities allowed; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) any rules that change, affect, or determine any part of the published rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A joint tariff filed by a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter shall identify the carriers that are parties to it. The carriers that are parties to a joint tariff, other than the carrier filing it, must file a concurrence or acceptance of the tariff with the Commission but are not required to file a copy of the tariff. The Commission may prescribe or approve what constitutes a concurrence or acceptance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When a common carrier (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice defined in section 10102(13), or in a noncontiguous domestic trade) providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission (A) under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title proposes to change a rate, or (B) under another subchapter of that chapter proposes to change a rate, classification, rule, or practice, the carrier shall publish, file, and keep open for public inspection a notice of the proposed change as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a contract carrier (except a motor contract carrier of property) providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title proposes to establish a new rate or to reduce a rate, directly or by changing a rule or practice related to the rate or the value of service under the rate, the carrier shall publish, file, and keep open for public inspection a notice of the new or reduced rate as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A notice filed under this subsection shall plainly identify the proposed change or new or reduced rate and indicate its proposed effective date. In the case of a carrier other than a rail carrier and motor common carrier of passengers with respect to special or charter transportation, a proposed rate change or a new or reduced rate may not become effective for 30 days after the notice is published, filed, and held open as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section. In the case of a rail carrier, a proposed rate change resulting in an increased rate or a new rate shall not become effective for 20 days after the notice is published and a proposed rate change resulting in a reduced rate shall not become effective for 10 days after the notice is published, except that a contract authorized under section 10713 of this title shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of such section. In the case of a motor common carrier of passengers, a proposed rate change resulting in an increased rate or a new rate applicable to special or charter transportation shall not become effective for 30 days after the notice is published, and a proposed rate change resulting in a reduced rate applicable to special or charter transportation shall not become effective for 10 days after the notice is published.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission may reduce the notice period of subsections (a) and (c) of this section if cause exists. The Commission may change the other requirements of this section if cause exists in particular instances or as they apply to special circumstances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may prescribe regulations for the simplification of tariffs by carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title and permit them to change rates, classifications, rules, and practices without filing complete tariffs that cover matter that is not being changed when the Commission finds that action to be consistent with the public interest. Those carriers may publish new tariffs that incorporate changes or plainly indicate the proposed changes in the tariffs then in effect and kept open for public inspection. However, the Commission shall require that all rates of rail carriers and rail rate-making associations be incorporated in their individual tariffs by the end of the 2d year after initial publication of the rate, or by the end of the 2d year after a change in a rate becomes effective, whichever is later. The Commission may extend those periods if cause exists, but if it does, it must send a notice of the extension and a statement of the reasons for the extension to Congress. A rate not incorporated in an individual tariff as required by the Commission is void.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may reject a tariff submitted to it by a common carrier under this section if that tariff violates this section or regulation of the Commission carrying out this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may grant relief from this section to contract carriers when relief is consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a contract carrier or group of contract carriers and on its own initiative for a water contract carrier or group of water contract carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission shall streamline and simplify, to the maximum extent practicable, the filing requirements applicable under this section to motor common carriers of property with respect to transportation provided under certificates to which the provisions of section 10922(b)(4)(E)&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Customer Account Codes.&#8212;No tariff filed by a motor carrier of property with the Commission before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection may be held invalid solely on the basis that a numerical or alpha account code is used in such tariff to designate customers or to describe the applicability of rates. For transportation performed on and after the 180th day following such date of enactment, the name of the customer for each account code must be set forth in the tariff (other than the tariff of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Range Tariffs.&#8212;No tariff filed by a motor carrier of property with the Commission before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection may be held invalid solely on the basis that the tariff does not show a specific rate or discount for a specific shipment if the tariff is based on a range of rates or discounts for specific classes of shipments. For transportation performed on or after the 180th day following such date of enactment, such a range tariff must identify the specific rate or discount from among the range of rates or discounts contained in such range tariff which is applicable to each specific shipment or must contain an objective means for determining the rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) Nothing in this section shall affect the application of the provisions of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 (or the amendments made by that Act) to undercharge claims for transportation provided prior to the date of enactment of the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When a person delivers property to a rail carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, the person may direct the carrier to transport the property over an established through route. When competing rail lines constitute a part of the route, the person shipping the property may designate the lines over which the property will be transported. The designation must be in writing. A carrier may be directed to transport property over a particular through route when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are at least 2 through routes over which the property could be transported;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a through rate has been established for transportation over each of those through routes; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the carrier is a party to those routes and rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A carrier directed to route property transported under paragraph (1) of this subsection must issue a through bill of lading containing the routing instructions and transport the property according to the instructions. When the property is delivered to a connecting carrier, that carrier must also receive and transport it according to the routing instructions and deliver it to the next succeeding carrier or consignee according to the instructions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no direction is made under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may designate the route over which the property may be transported after arrival at the end of the route of one carrier or at a junction with the route of another carrier when the property is to be delivered to another carrier for further transportation. The Commission may act under this subsection when the public interest and a fair distribution of traffic require that action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may prescribe exceptions to the authority of a person to direct the movement of traffic under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

The Commission may keep itself informed of current changes in costs and values of railroad property to carry out this section. When necessary, the Commission may correct, revise, and supplement an inventory or valuation of property it has made.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10785 &#183; Finality of valuation: notice, protest, and review</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall notify the carrier, the Attorney General, and the chief executive officer of each State in which property being valued under this subchapter is located, of the completion of a tentative valuation of that property. The Commission may also notify other parties. The notice must be sent by certified mail and must indicate the valuation established for each of that carrier's classes of property. A valuation of property under this subchapter becomes final if a protest is not filed within 30 days after notice of the tentative valuation of that property is given. When the tentative valuation becomes final under this subsection, the effective date is the date of the tentative valuation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a carrier files a protest of a tentative valuation, the Commission shall begin a proceeding to consider the protest. If the Commission decides that a tentative valuation should be changed, it may make the necessary changes. The tentative valuation, as changed, becomes final and is effective on the date of the final action of the Commission under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall publish final valuations and classifications of property established under this subchapter. A final valuation or classification that has become effective under this subchapter is prima facie evidence of the value of the property in a proceeding under this subtitle and in a judicial proceeding to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend an action of the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) When evidence is introduced at the trial of an action involving a final valuation of property established by the Commission and found by the court to be different from the evidence offered to the Commission during a proceeding under subsection (b) of this section or in addition to that evidence and substantially affecting the valuation, the court shall send a copy of that evidence to the Commission and stay further proceedings in the action. The court may determine the duration of the stay of proceedings. The Commission shall consider the evidence and may change the final valuation established under this subchapter. The Commission shall complete its action and report to the court in the time determined by the court. If the Commission changes the valuation, the court must substitute the valuation as changed for the original valuation and give its judgment on the substituted valuation. If the Commission does not change the original valuation, the court must give judgment on the original valuation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10904 &#183; Filing and procedure for applications to abandon or discontinue</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) An application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance under section 10903 of this title, and a notice of intent to abandon or discontinue, must be filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title files an application and notice of intent, the notice shall include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an accurate and understandable summary of the rail carrier's application and the reasons for the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) a statement that the line is available for subsidy or sale in accordance with section 10905 of this title, (ii) a statement that the carrier will promptly provide to each interested party an estimate of the subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line in operation, calculated in accordance with section 10905 of this title, and (iii) the name and business address of the person who is authorized to discuss sale or subsidy terms for the carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The rail carrier shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) send by certified mail a copy of the notice of intent to the chief executive officer of each State that would be directly affected by the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) post a copy of the notice in each terminal and station on each portion of a railroad line proposed to be abandoned or over which all transportation is to be discontinued;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) publish a copy of the notice for 3 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which each such portion is located;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) mail a copy of the notice, to the extent practicable, to all shippers that have made significant use (as designated by the Commission) of the railroad line during the 12 months preceding the filing of the application; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) attach to the notice filed with the Commission an affidavit certifying the manner in which clauses (A)&#8211;(D) of this paragraph have been satisfied, and certifying that clauses (A)&#8211;(D) have been satisfied within the most recent 30 days prior to the date the application is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no protest is received within 30 days after the application is filed, the Commission shall find that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance. In such a case, the Commission shall, within 45 days after the application is filed, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinuance to occur within 75 days after the application is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a protest is received within 30 days after the application is filed, the Commission shall, within 45 days after the application is filed, determine whether an investigation is needed to assist in determining what disposition to make of the application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission decides that no investigation is to be undertaken, the Commission shall, within 75 days after the application is filed, decide whether the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance, taking into consideration the application of the rail carrier and any materials submitted by protestants. If the Commission finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment, it shall, within 90 days after the date of application, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinuance to occur within 120 days after the application is filed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Commission decides that an investigation should be undertaken under this section, the investigation must be completed within 135 days, and an initial decision must be rendered within 165 days, after the date the application is filed. Thirty days after such decision, the initial decision shall become the final decision of the Commission unless, during the interim, the Commission decides to hear appeals. If an initial decision is appealed and considered by the Commission, the Commission shall issue a final decision within 255 days after the date of application. Whenever the Commission decides upon investigation that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance of rail service, it shall, within 15 days of the final decision, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinuance to occur within 75 days of the date of the final decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The effective date of any certificate which permits abandonment or discontinuance may be stayed by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 10905 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The burden is on the person applying for the certificate to prove that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For applications approved by the Secretary of Transportation as part of a plan or proposal under section 333(a)&#8211;(d) of this title, the Commission shall consider whether any detriment from the abandonment or discontinuance exceeds the transportation benefit from the plan or proposal as a whole.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In this subsection, &#8220;potentially subject to abandonment&#8221; has the meaning given the term in regulations of the Commission. The regulations may include standards that vary by region of the United States and by railroad or group of railroads.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each rail carrier shall maintain a complete diagram of the transportation system operated, directly or indirectly, by the carrier. The carrier shall submit to the Commission and publish amendments to its diagram that are necessary to maintain the accuracy of the diagram. The diagram shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include a detailed description of each of its railroad lines potentially subject to abandonment; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify each railroad line for which the carrier plans to file an application for a certificate under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a shipper or other person that has made significant use (as determined by the Commission) of the railroad line involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance during the 12-month period before the filing of the application for a certificate; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a State or political subdivision of a State in which any part of the railroad line is located;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission may issue a certificate under section 10903 of this title only if the railroad line has been described and identified in the diagram or amendment to the diagram of the rail carrier that was submitted to the Commission at least 4 months before the date on which the application was filed, except that the requirement of such description or identification in such diagram may be waived by the Commission if the application was approved by the Secretary of Transportation as part of a plan or proposal under section 333(a)&#8211;(d) of this title, or the application is filed by a railroad in bankruptcy.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10905 &#183; Offers of financial assistance to avoid abandonment and discontinuance</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &#8220;avoidable cost&#8221; means all expenses that would be incurred by a rail carrier in providing transportation that would not be incurred if the railroad line over which the transportation was provided were abandoned or if the transportation were discontinued. Expenses include cash inflows foregone and cash outflows incurred by the rail carrier as a result of not abandoning or discontinuing the transportation. Cash inflows foregone and cash outflows incurred include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) working capital and required capital expenditure;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expenditures to eliminate deferred maintenance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the current cost of freight cars, locomotives, and other equipment; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the foregone tax benefits from not retiring properties from rail service and other effects of applicable Federal and State income taxes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &#8220;reasonable return&#8221; means&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if a rail carrier is not in reorganization, the cost of capital to the rail carrier, as determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if a rail carrier is in reorganization, the mean cost of capital of rail carriers not in reorganization, as determined by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any rail carrier which has filed an application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance shall provide promptly to a party considering an offer of financial assistance and shall provide concurrently to the Commission&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line or a portion of the line in operation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) its most recent reports on the physical condition of that part of the railroad line involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance which would be required to continue rail transportation over that part of the railroad line; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any other information that the Commission may deem necessary to allow a potential offeror to calculate an adequate subsidy or purchase offer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the Commission finds under section 10903 of this title that the public convenience and necessity require or permit abandonment or discontinuance of a particular railroad line, it shall, concurrently with service of the decision upon the parties, publish the finding in the Federal Register. Within 10 days following the publication, any person may offer to pay the carrier a subsidy or offer to purchase the line. Such offer shall be filed concurrently with the Commission. If the offer to subsidize or purchase the line is less than the carrier's estimate provided under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the offer shall explain the basis of the disparity, and the manner in which the offer of subsidy or purchase is calculated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) If, within 15 days after the publication required in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority) has offered financial assistance to enable the rail transportation to be continued over that part of the railroad line to be abandoned or over which all rail transportation is to be discontinued; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is likely that the assistance would be equal to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the difference between the revenues attributable to that part of the railroad line and the avoidable cost of providing rail freight transportation on the line, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition cost of that part of the railroad line;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall postpone the issuance of a certificate authorizing abandonment or discontinuance in accordance with subsections (e) and (f) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the carrier and a person offering financial assistance enter into an agreement which will provide continued rail service, the Commission shall postpone the issuance of the certificate for so long as the agreement, or an extension or modification of the agreement, is in effect. If the carrier and a person offering to purchase a line enter into an agreement which will provide continued rail service, the Commission shall approve the transaction and dismiss the application for abandonment or discontinuance. If the carrier and a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority) fail to agree on the amount or terms of the subsidy or purchase, either party may, within 30 days after the offer is made, request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation. If no agreement is reached within 30 days after the offer is made and neither party requests that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation during that same period, the Commission shall immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Whenever the Commission is requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation under this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Commission shall render its decision within 60 days;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where subsidy has been offered, the Commission shall determine the amount and terms of subsidy based on the avoidable cost of providing continued rail transportation, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) where an offer of purchase has been made in order to continue rail service on the line, the Commission shall determine the price and other terms of sale. In no case shall the Commission set a price which is below the fair market value of the line (including, unless otherwise mutually agreed, all facilities on the line or portion necessary to provide effective transportation services).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The decision of the Commission shall be binding on both parties, except that the person who has offered to subsidize or purchase the line may withdraw his offer within 10 days of the Commission's decision. In such a case, the Commission shall immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance, unless other offers are being considered pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a carrier receives more than one offer to purchase or subsidize, it shall select the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, and complete the sale or subsidy agreement, or request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation prior to the 40th day after the date on which notice was published under subsection (c) of this section. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached within the 40-day period and the Commission has not been requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other offeror may request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation. If the Commission has established the conditions and amount of compensation and the original offer has been withdrawn, any other offeror may accept the Commission's decision within 20 days of such decision, and the Commission shall require the carrier to enter into a sale or subsidy agreement with such offeror, if such sale or agreement incorporates the Commission's decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) No purchaser of a line or portion of line sold under this section may transfer or discontinue service on such line prior to the end of the second year after consummation of the sale, nor may such purchaser transfer such line, except to the carrier from whom it was purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation of the sale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any subsidy provided under this section may be discontinued on notice of 60 days. Unless, within such 60-day period, another financially responsible party enters into a subsidy agreement at least as beneficial to the carrier as that which was or was to be discontinued, the Commission shall, at the carrier's request, immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance of service on the line.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the carrier, notwithstanding that law, regulation, order, or proceeding, may discontinue or change the transportation&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if it files a notice of the proposed discontinuance or change with the Commission at least 30 days before the discontinuance or change is intended to be effective and carries out the discontinuance or change under that notice;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if it mails a copy of the notice to the chief executive officer of each State in which the train or ferry is operated and posts a copy of the notice at each station, depot, or other facility served by the train or ferry; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) On petition or on its own initiative, the Commission may conduct a proceeding on the proposed discontinuance or change if it begins the proceeding between the date the carrier files the notice under subsection (a) of this section and the date on which the discontinuance or change is intended to be effective. After the proceeding begins, the Commission may order the carrier proposing the discontinuance or change to continue any part of the transportation pending completion of the proceeding and the decision of the Commission if the Commission serves a copy of its order on the carrier at least 10 days before the date on which the carrier intended the discontinuance or change to be effective.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) If, after a proceeding completed either before or after the proposed discontinuance or change has become effective, the Commission finds that any part of the transportation is required or permitted by present or future public convenience and necessity and will not unreasonably burden interstate or foreign commerce, the Commission may order the carrier to continue or restore that transportation for not to exceed one year from the date of the Commission order. On expiration of the Commission order, the jurisdiction of each State involved in the discontinuance or change is no longer superseded except to the extent this section is again invoked.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10909 &#183; Discontinuing or changing train or ferry transportation in one State</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title has proposed a discontinuance or change of any part of the transportation of a train or ferry operated by it entirely in one State and&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the law of the State prohibits the discontinuance or change;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &#8220;financially responsible person&#8221; means a person who (A) is capable of paying the constitutional minimum value of the railroad line proposed to be acquired, and (B) is able to assure that adequate transportation will be provided over such line for a period of not less than 3 years. Such term includes a governmental authority but does not include a class I or a class II rail carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &#8220;railroad line&#8221; means (A) during the 3-year period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, a line of railroad which carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year, and (B) after the end of such 3-year period, any line of railroad.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When the Interstate Commerce Commission finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line under this section; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a railroad line is on a system diagram map as required under section 10904 of this title, but the rail carrier owning such line has not filed an application to abandon such line under sections 10903 and 10904 of this title before an application to purchase such line, or any required preliminary filing with respect to such application, is filed under this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an application to purchase such line has been filed, in accordance with regulations required under subsection (k) of this section, by a financially responsible person,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall require the rail carrier owning the railroad line to sell such line to such financially responsible person at a price not less than the constitutional minimum value.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the constitutional minimum value of a particular railroad line shall be presumed to be not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line, whichever is greater, but shall not include the cost of providing a protective arrangement under subsection (j) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For purposes of this section, the Commission may determine that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a railroad line if the Commission determines, after a hearing on the record, that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the rail carrier operating such line refuses within a reasonable time to make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to shippers who transport traffic over such line;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transportation over such line is inadequate for the majority of shippers who transport traffic over such line;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the sale of such line will not have a significantly adverse financial effect on the rail carrier operating such line;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the sale of such line will not have an adverse effect on the overall operational performance of the rail carrier operating such line; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the sale of such line will be likely to result in improved railroad transportation for shippers that transport traffic over such line.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under this subsection, the burden of proving that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line is on the person filing the application to acquire such line. If the Commission finds under this subsection that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line, the Commission shall concurrently notify the parties of such finding and publish such finding in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In the case of any railroad line subject to sale under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall, upon the request of the acquiring carrier, require the selling carrier to provide to the acquiring carrier trackage rights to allow a reasonable interchange with the selling carrier or to move power equipment or empty rolling stock between noncontiguous feeder lines operated by the acquiring carrier. The Commission shall require the acquiring carrier to provide the selling carrier reasonable compensation for any such trackage rights.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall require, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of the employees who would normally have performed work in connection with a railroad line subject to a sale under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) In the case of a railroad line which carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year, whenever a purchasing carrier under this section petitions the Commission for joint rates applicable to traffic moving over through routes in which the purchasing carrier may practicably participate, the Commission shall, within 30 days after the date such petition is filed and pursuant to section 10705(a) of this title, require the establishment of reasonable joint rates and divisions over such route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may elect to be exempt from any of the provisions of this subtitle, except that such a person may not be exempt from the provisions of chapter 107 of this title with respect to transportation under a joint rate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall apply to any line of railroad which was abandoned during the 18-month period immediately prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and was subsequently purchased by a financially responsible person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) If a purchasing carrier under this section proposes to sell or abandon all or any portion of a purchased railroad line, such purchasing carrier shall offer the right of first refusal with respect to such line or portion thereof to the carrier which sold such line under this section. Such offer shall be made at a price equal to the sum of the price paid by such purchasing carrier to such selling carrier for such line or portion thereof and the fair market value (less deterioration) of any improvements made, as adjusted to reflect inflation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may determine preconditions, such as payment of a subsidy, which must be met by shippers in order to obtain service over such lines, but such operator must notify the shippers on the line of its intention to impose such preconditions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) In the case of any railroad line sold pursuant to this section, the Commission shall require the selling carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that established under section 11347 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k) The Commission shall, within 60 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, prescribe such regulations and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

Upon issuance of such certificate, the carrier shall establish initial rates, rules, and practices applicable to such transportation to the same extent and in the same manner as a motor common carrier of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under such subchapter establishes rates, rules, and practices applicable to such interstate transportation. Any such rate, rule, or practice (including changes thereto) shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 107 of this title as if such rate, rule, or practice were related to interstate transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Not later than 30 days after the date on which a motor common carrier of passengers first begins providing transportation entirely in one State pursuant to a certificate issued under this paragraph, the carrier shall take all action necessary to establish under the laws of such State rates, rules, and practices applicable to such transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(J) Limitation on intrastate certificates.&#8212;Each certificate issued under this paragraph to provide intrastate transportation of passengers on any route shall be subject to a condition which limits the authority of the carrier to provide intrastate transportation service under the certificate only if the carrier provides regularly scheduled interstate transportation service on the route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making any findings relating to public interest under paragraphs (1) and (2)(B) of this subsection, the Commission shall consider, to the extent applicable&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection relating to the Commission finding that transportation to be authorized by issuance of a certificate is not consistent with the public interest shall not apply to any application under this subsection for authority to provide&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) A person holding (A) a certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section to provide transportation as a motor common carrier of property, and (B) a permit issued under section 10923 of this title to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier of property, may transport property under the certificate in the same motor vehicle and at the same time as property under the permit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, a motor common carrier of passengers who has authority under this section to provide special or charter transportation of passengers and to provide regular-route transportation of passengers may transport the special or charter passengers in the same motor vehicle with regular-route passengers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall only apply to transportation of passengers entirely in a State if the motor common carrier of passengers has authority under the laws of such State to provide within such State special or charter transportation of passengers and regular-route transportation of passengers and if the laws of such State and the certificate, permit, or other authority under which such carrier provides intrastate transportation in such State authorizes such carrier to transport special or charter passengers in the same motor vehicle with regular-route passengers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Special or charter transportation of passengers may only be provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same motor vehicle as regular-route transportation of passengers if the mixing of such passengers does not interfere with the obligation of the carrier to comply with section 11101 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to such regulations as the Commission may issue, a person who has authority under this section to provide charter transportation of passengers may transport groups of charter passengers in the same motor vehicle at the same time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(l) A motor common carrier of property may deliver to or receive from a rail carrier a trailer moving in trailer-on-flat-car service at any point on the route of the rail carrier if the motor carrier is authorized to serve the origin and destination points of the traffic.</p>

The President of the United States may extend, beyond such four-year period, such moratorium or impose such a moratorium with respect to any contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The President of the United States may remove or modify, in whole or in part, any moratorium imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection on the issuance of certificates or permits if the President determines that such removal or modification is in the national interest and notifies, in writing, the Congress of such removal or modification before the date on which such removal or modification is to take effect. In any case in which such moratorium applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision, such removal or modification shall not take effect before the 60th day following the date on which the Congress is notified of such removal or modification.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to the provisions of this subparagraph, during a moratorium imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to any contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof, the Commission may issue certificates of registration under section 10530 of this subtitle to foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers domiciled in such country or political subdivision and to foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers owned or controlled by persons of such country or political subdivision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Subject to clause (iv) of this subparagraph, if the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision or is a foreign motor carrier owned or controlled by persons of the foreign country or political subdivision, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle in a municipality in the United States which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, in contiguous municipalities in the United States any one of which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, or in a zone in the United States that is adjacent to, and commercially a part of, the municipality or municipalities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Subject to clause (v) of this subsection, if the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision or is a foreign motor private carrier owned or controlled by persons of the foreign country or political subdivision, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle in a municipality in the United States which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, in contiguous municipalities in the United States any one of which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, or in a zone in the United States that is adjacent to, and commercially a part of, the municipality or municipalities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(v) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(vi) In this subparagraph, the terms &#8220;exempt items&#8221;, &#8220;foreign motor carrier&#8221;, &#8220;foreign motor private carrier&#8221;, and &#8220;interstate transportation&#8221; have the meanings such terms have under section 10530(a) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;10935 &#183; Discontinuing bus transportation in one State</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a motor common carrier of passengers having intrastate authority under the laws of a State, and interstate authority under a certificate issued under section 10922 of this title, to provide transportation over any route to any point in such State has proposed to discontinue providing transportation over such route to such point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) and the carrier has requested the department, agency, or instrumentality of such State having jurisdiction over granting such discontinuance or reduction for permission to discontinue such intrastate transportation or to reduce its level of service to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) and the request has been denied (in whole or in part) or such department, agency, or instrumentality has not acted finally (in whole or in part) on the request by the 120th day after the carrier made the request, the carrier may petition the Commission for such permission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a petition is filed under subsection (a) of this section, the carrier shall certify that he has notified (1) the Governor of the State in which such transportation is provided, (2) the State authority having jurisdiction over granting discontinuances of transportation by motor common carriers of passengers and reductions in levels of service by such carriers, (3) local governments having jurisdiction over areas which would be affected if such petition is granted, and (4) such other interested persons as the Commission may specify by regulation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any person (including a department, agency, or instrumentality of a State or local government) may object to the Commission to the granting of permission to any motor common carrier of passengers to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) If no person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the granting of permission to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section within 20 days after the carrier files with the Commission the petition for such discontinuance or reduction, the Commission shall grant such permission at the end of such 20-day period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, if, within 20 days after a carrier files a petition for permission to discontinue providing intrastate transportation over any route to any point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays), any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the Commission to the granting of such permission, the Commission shall grant such permission unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by the person objecting to the granting of such permission, that such discontinuance or reduction is not consistent with the public interest or that continuing the transportation, without the proposed discontinuance or reduction, will not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply to intrastate transportation of passengers which is being provided by a motor common carrier of passengers on a route over which such carrier was granted, on or before August 1, 1982, authority to provide interstate transportation of passengers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, if, within 20 days after a carrier files a petition for permission to discontinue providing intrastate transportation over any route to any point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays), any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the Commission to the granting of such permission, the Commission shall grant such permission unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by the person objecting to the granting of such permission, that continuing the transportation, without the proposed discontinuance or reduction, will not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. For the purposes of this paragraph, continuance of the transportation would not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce only if discontinuance or reduction of such transportation is not consistent with the public interest and the interstate and intrastate revenues from such service under reasonable pricing practices are not less than the variable costs of providing the transportation proposed to be discontinued or reduced.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply to intrastate transportation of passengers which is being provided by a motor common carrier of passengers on a route over which such carrier was granted after August 1, 1982, and before the effective date of this section, or is granted on or after such effective date, authority to provide interstate transportation of passengers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall only grant permission to a carrier to discontinue intrastate transportation over any route to any point under this subsection if such carrier has applied for authority to discontinue its interstate transportation over such route to such point under section 10925(b) of this title and the Commission has granted or will grant such authority.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the granting of permission to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section within 20 days after the carrier files with the Commission the petition for such discontinuance or reduction, the carrier, within 15 days after the filing of such objection with the Commission, shall furnish to the Commission and to objecting persons&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an estimate of the annual subsidy required, if any, to continue the service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance, if any, which would be required to continue the service; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such other information as the Commission may require by regulation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall take final action upon such petition not later than 90 days after the date the carrier files such petition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Before a discontinuance or reduction in level of service proposed in a petition filed by a carrier under subsection (a) of this section has become effective, the Commission may order the carrier to continue any part of the intrastate transportation in not to exceed the 165-day period beginning on the date the carrier files such petition with the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In making a finding under subsection (e)(1) of this section, the Commission shall accord great weight to the extent to which interstate and intrastate revenues received for providing the transportation proposed to be discontinued or reduced are less than the variable costs of providing such transportation, including depreciation for revenue equipment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the carrier filing a petition for permission to discontinue or reduce service shall have the burden of proving the amount of the interstate and intrastate revenues received for providing the transportation and the variable costs of providing the transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a finding under subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, the Commission shall consider, to the extent applicable, at least&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the national transportation policy of section 10101 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the motor common carrier of passengers has received an offer of, or is receiving, financial assistance to provide the transportation to be discontinued or reduced from a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a petition to discontinue transportation to any point, whether the transportation is the last motor carrier of passenger service to such point and whether a reasonable alternative to such service is available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) No State or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency or other agency of two or more States shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to discontinuance or reduction in the level of intrastate service by a motor common carrier of passengers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title corresponding to an interstate service initiated pursuant to the provisions of section 10922(c)(4)&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall provide the transportation or service on reasonable request. In addition, a motor common carrier shall provide safe and adequate service, equipment, and facilities. A rail carrier shall not be found to have violated this section because it fulfills its commitments under contracts approved under section 10713 of this title before responding to reasonable requests for service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may prescribe requirements for continuous and adequate transportation and service provided by motor common carriers and household goods freight forwarders subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapters II and IV of chapter 105 of this title and for transportation of baggage and express by such motor common carriers of passengers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to be used is that of (i) a farmer or a cooperative association or a federation of cooperative associations under section 10526(a)(4) or (5) of this title, or (ii) a motor private carrier and it is used regularly in the transportation of property referred to in section 10526(a)(6) of this title, or perishable products manufactured from perishable property referred to in that section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is to be used by the carrier in a single movement or in one or more of a series of movements, loaded or empty, in the general direction of the general area where the motor vehicle is based; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the motor vehicle to be used has completed a movement exempt under section 10526(a)(6) of this title and is next to be used by that carrier in a loaded movement in any direction or in a movement referred to in clause (1)(B) of this subsection, or both.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Resolution of Disputes Relating to Contract or Common Carrier Capacities.&#8212;If a motor carrier (other than a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods) subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title has authority to provide transportation as both a motor common carrier and a motor contract carrier and a dispute arises as to whether certain transportation is provided in its common carrier or contract carrier capacity and the parties are not able to resolve the dispute consensually, the Commission shall have jurisdiction to, and shall, resolve the dispute.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may require terminal facilities, including main-line tracks for a reasonable distance outside of a terminal, owned by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, to be used by another rail carrier if the Commission finds that use to be practicable and in the public interest without substantially impairing the ability of the rail carrier owning the facilities or entitled to use the facilities to handle its own business. The carriers are responsible for establishing the conditions and compensation for use of the facilities. However, if the carriers cannot agree, the Commission may establish conditions and compensation for use of the facilities under the principle controlling compensation in condemnation proceedings. The compensation shall be paid or adequately secured before a carrier may begin to use the facilities of another carrier under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A rail carrier whose terminal facilities are required to be used by another carrier under this section is entitled to recover damages from the other carrier for injuries sustained as the result of compliance with the requirement or for compensation for the use, or both, as appropriate, in a civil action, if it is not satisfied with the conditions for use of the facilities or if the amount of the compensation is not paid promptly.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may require rail carriers to enter into reciprocal switching agreements, where it finds such agreements to be practicable and in the public interest, or where such agreements are necessary to provide competitive rail service. The carriers entering into such an agreement shall establish the conditions and compensation applicable to such agreement, but, if the carriers cannot agree upon such conditions and compensation within a reasonable period of time, the Commission may establish such conditions and compensation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require reciprocal switching agreements entered into by rail carriers pursuant to this subsection to contain provisions for the protection of the interests of employees affected thereby.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations of the Commission protecting individual shippers shall include, where appropriate, reasonable performance standards for the transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. In establishing performance standards under this paragraph, the Commission shall take into account at least the following:</p>

The Commission shall not prescribe specific formulas, forms, methods, or techniques for providing a prospective shipper with such an estimate. The Commission shall not prohibit any such carrier from charging a prospective shipper for providing a written, binding estimate for the transportation and proposed services, nor shall the Commission require the final charges to a shipper to be based on an estimate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any charge for an estimate of charges provided by a motor common carrier to a shipper for transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The specific regulatory purposes for which railroad costs are required.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The degree of accuracy of the cost information which is needed to meet regulatory purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The existing capability and the probable future capability of rail carriers to provide such information and the relative benefits and costs of requiring development of additional capability.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The means by which the degree of economic accuracy required can be obtained at the least possible expense and with the least possible information reporting.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The means by which the confidentiality of such costs can best be maintained while meeting the need for such information in regulatory proceedings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The cost accounting principles established by the Board shall require that cost information be reported or disclosed only for the essential regulatory purposes defined by the Board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the establishment of cost accounting principles by the Railroad Accounting Principles Board under section 11162 of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall promptly promulgate rules to implement and enforce such principles. Not less than once every five years after the promulgation of the original rules, the Commission shall review the principles of the Board and shall, by rule, make such changes in such principles as are required to achieve the regulatory purposes of this subtitle and the goals of this subchapter. The Commission shall insure that the rules promulgated under this section are the most efficient and least burdensome means by which the required information may be developed for regulatory purposes.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11164 &#183; Certification of rail carrier cost accounting systems</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, each rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall file with the Commission a request for preliminary certification of its cost accounting system. The Commission shall grant such preliminary certification if it determines that the cost accounting system of such rail carrier is in compliance with the accounting standards of the Commission in effect on the day prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) As soon as practicable, but not later than 9 months, after the promulgation of rules by the Commission under section 11163 of this title, each rail carrier described in subsection (a) of this section shall file with the Commission a request for final certification of its cost accounting system developed to comply with this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 90 days, or such additional time as the Commission finds necessary, after a rail carrier files its request for final certification under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall grant such final certification to such carrier if the Commission determines that the cost accounting system of such carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title. If the Commission denies such final certification, the rail carrier shall revise its cost accounting system and file a new request for certification within 90 days after the date of such denial. The Commission shall thereupon grant final certification if it determines that such cost accounting system, as revised, is in compliance with such rules. If the Commission again denies final certification to the rail carrier, the Commission shall prescribe a cost accounting system which such carrier shall adopt within a reasonable time and which shall be considered a finally certified cost accounting system for purposes of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each rail carrier shall have and maintain a cost accounting system that is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Certification under this section that the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title shall be valid until the promulgation of new rules by the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is certified under this section, such rail carrier may, after notifying the Commission, make modifications in such system unless, within 60 days after the date of notification, the Commission finds such modifications to be inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of determining whether the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission, the Commission shall have the right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records of such rail carrier relating to compliance with such rules. Such documents, papers, and records (and any copies thereof) shall not be subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements of section 552 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) To obtain expense and revenue information for regulatory purposes, the Interstate Commerce Commission may promulgate reasonable rules for rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, prescribing expense and revenue accounting and reporting requirements consistent with generally accepted accounting principles uniformly applied to such carriers. Such requirements shall be cost effective and compatible with and not duplicative of the managerial and responsibility accounting requirements of those carriers. To the extent such rules are required solely to provide expense and revenue information necessary for determining railroad costs in regulatory proceedings under this subtitle, such rules shall be promulgated in accordance with the cost accounting principles established by the Railroad Accounting Principles Board under section 11162 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11301 &#183; Authority of certain carriers to issue securities and assume obligations and liabilities</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &#8220;carrier&#8221; means a rail or sleeping car carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title (except a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway not operated as a part of a general railroad system of transportation), and a corporation organized to provide transportation by rail carrier subject to that subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &#8220;security&#8221; means a share of capital stock, a bond, or other evidence of interest in, or indebtedness of, a carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.), and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a&#8211;1 et seq.), the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to approve the issuance of securities by a carrier and the assumption of an obligation or liability related to the securities of another person by a carrier. A carrier may not issue securities or assume those obligations or liabilities without the approval of the Commission. No other approval is required. A security issued or obligation or liability assumed by a carrier in violation of this subsection or in violation of a condition prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d) of this section is void. However, a security or obligation issued or assumed under authority of this section is not void for failure to comply with a procedural requirement of this section or other matter preceding entry of the order of the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply to notes issued by a carrier if the notes mature not more than 2 years after their date of issue and total (with all then outstanding notes having a maturity of not more than 2 years) not more than 5 percent of the par value of the then outstanding securities of that carrier. If the securities do not have a par value, the par value of those securities is the fair market value on the date of issue. Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a subsequent funding of notes referred to in this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A carrier issuing notes referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall file a certificate of notification with the Commission by the end of the 10th day after they are issued. That notification must include substantially the same matter required by the Commission for an application for authority to issue other securities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A carrier that pledges, repledges, or otherwise disposes of a security referred to in an application for authority or a certificate of notification under this section as pledged or held unencumbered in the treasury of that carrier shall file a certificate of notification with the Commission by the end of the 10th day after it disposes of the security.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on application of a carrier. Before taking final action, the Commission must investigate the purpose and use of the securities issue or assumption and the proceeds from it. The Commission may approve any part of the application and may require the carrier to comply with appropriate conditions. After an application is approved under this section, the Commission may change a condition previously imposed or use that may be made of the securities or proceeds for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this section. The Commission may approve an application under this section only when it finds that the securities issue or assumption&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is for a lawful object within the corporate purpose of the carrier and reasonably appropriate for that purpose;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is compatible with the public interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) will not impair the financial ability of the carrier to provide the service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application or certificate must be made under oath and signed and filed for the carrier by a designated executive officer who knows the matters stated in the application or certificate. On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section, the Commission shall have a copy of the application served on the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall require a carrier that issues securities, including notes, under this section to submit reports to it. The reports must identify the disposition of those securities and the application of the proceeds from their disposition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not imply a guaranty or obligation of those securities by the United States Government. This section does not apply to securities issued or obligations or liabilities assumed by the United States Government, a State, or an instrumentality or political subdivision of one of them.</p>

An assignment of a right or interest under one of those instruments and an amendment to that instrument or assignment including a release, discharge, or satisfaction of any part of it may also be filed with the Commission. The instrument, assignment, or amendment must be in writing, executed by the parties to it, and acknowledged or verified under Commission regulations. When filed under this section, that document is notice to, and enforceable against, all persons. A document filed under this section does not have to be filed, deposited, registered, or recorded under another law of the United States, a State (or its political subdivisions), or territory or possession of the United States, related to filing, deposit, registration, or recordation of those documents. This section does not change chapter 313 of title 46.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission shall maintain a system for recording each document filed under subsection (a) of this section and mark each of them with a consecutive number and the date and hour of their recordation. The Commission shall maintain and keep open for public inspection an index of documents filed under that subsection. That index shall include the name and address of the principal debtors, trustees, guarantors, and other parties to those documents and may include other facts that will assist in determining the rights of the parties to those transactions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &#8220;perfection&#8221;, as related to a security interest, means taking action (including public filing, recording, notation on a certificate of title, and possession of collateral by the secured party), or the existence of facts, required under law to make a security interest enforceable against general creditors and subsequent lien creditors of a debtor, but does not include compliance with requirements related only to the establishment of a valid security interest between the debtor and the secured party.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A security interest in a motor vehicle owned by, or in the possession and use of, a carrier having a certificate or permit issued under section 10922 or 10923 of this title and owing payment or performance of an obligation secured by that security interest is perfected in all jurisdictions against all general, and subsequent lien, creditors of, and all persons taking a motor vehicle by sale (or taking or retaining a security interest in a motor vehicle) from, that carrier when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a certificate of title is issued for a motor vehicle under a law of a jurisdiction that requires or permits indication, on a certificate or title, of a security interest in the motor vehicle if the security interest is indicated on the certificate;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11321 &#183; Limitation on ownership of certain water carriers</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Notwithstanding sections 11343 and 11344 of this title, a carrier, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a rail, express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not own, operate, control, or have an interest in a water common carrier or vessel carrying property or passengers on a water route with which it does or may compete for traffic.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may decide, after a full hearing, questions of fact related to competition or the possibility of competition under this subsection on application of a carrier. A carrier may file an application to determine whether an existing service violates this subsection and may request permission to continue operation of a vessel or that action be taken under subsection (b) of this section. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on its own initiative or on application of a shipper to investigate the operation of a vessel used by a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter if the carrier has not applied to the Commission and had the question of competition or the possibility of competition determined under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may authorize a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under that subchapter to own, operate, control, or have an interest in a water common carrier or vessel that is not operated through the Panama Canal and with which the carrier does or may compete for traffic when the Commission finds that ownership, operation, control, or interest will still allow that water common carrier or vessel to be operated in the public interest advantageously to interstate commerce and that it will still allow competition, without reduction, on the water route in question. However, section 11343 of this title also applies to a transaction or interest under this subsection if the transaction or interest is within the scope of that section. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a carrier. An authorization under this subsection is not necessary for a carrier that obtained an order of extension before September 18, 1940, under section 5(21) of the Interstate Commerce Act (37 Stat. 567), as amended, if the order is still in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may take action under this section only after a full hearing. An order entered as a result of the action may be conditioned on giving security for the payment of an amount of money or the discharge of an obligation that is required to be paid or discharged under that order.</p>

A carrier or corporation participating in or resulting from a transaction approved by or exempted by the Commission under this subchapter may carry out the transaction, own and operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired through the transaction without the approval of a State authority. A carrier, corporation, or person participating in that approved or exempted transaction is exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the transaction, hold, maintain, and operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired through the transaction. However, if a purchase and sale, a lease, or a corporate consolidation or merger is involved in the transaction, the carrier or corporation may carry out the transaction only with the assent of a majority, or the number required under applicable State law, of the votes of the holders of the capital stock of that corporation entitled to vote. The vote must occur at a regular meeting, or special meeting called for that purpose, of those stockholders and the notice of the meeting must indicate its purpose.</p>

Except as provided in subsection (b) for agreements or combinations between or among motor common carriers of property, the Commission may approve and authorize the agreement or combination if the carriers involved assent to the pooling or division and the Commission finds that a pooling or division of traffic, services, or earnings&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will not unreasonably restrain competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any motor common carrier of property may apply to the Commission for approval of an agreement or combination with another motor common carrier of property to pool or divide traffic or any services or any part of their earnings by filing such agreement or combination with the Commission not less than 50 days before its effective date. Prior to the effective date of the agreement or combination, the Commission shall determine whether the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance and whether there is substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition. If the Commission determines that neither of these two factors exists, it shall, prior to such effective date and without a hearing, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable. If the Commission determines either that the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance or that there is a substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition, the Commission shall hold a hearing concerning whether the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition and shall suspend operation of such agreement or combination pending such hearing and final decision thereon. After such hearing, the Commission shall indicate to what extent it finds that the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and will not unduly restrain competition and if assented to by all the carriers involved, shall, to that extent, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an application for Commission approval of an agreement or combination between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings, such agreement or combination shall be presumed to be in the interest of better service to the public and of economy in operation and not to restrain competition unduly if the practices proposed to be carried out under such agreement or combination are the same as or similar to practices carried out under agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings approved by the Commission before the date of enactment of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall streamline, simplify, and expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, the process (including, but not limited to, any paperwork) for submission and approval of applications under this section for agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods and their agents.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may impose conditions governing the pooling or division and may approve and authorize payment of a reasonable consideration between the carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) This section affects an agreement or combination filed with the Commission before March 19, 1941, to which a water common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title is a party only when the Commission determines that the agreement or combination does not meet the requirements for approval and authorization under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The following transactions involving carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I (except a pipeline carrier), II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may be carried out only with the approval and authorization of the Commission:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consolidation or merger of the properties or franchises of at least 2 carriers into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the previously separately owned properties.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a purchase, lease, or contract to operate property of another carrier by any number of carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) acquisition of control of at least 2 carriers by a person that is not a carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) acquisition of control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) acquisition by a rail carrier of trackage rights over, or joint ownership in or joint use of, a railroad line (and terminals incidental to it) owned or operated by another rail carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person may carry out a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section or participate in achieving the control or management, including the power to exercise control or management, in a common interest of more than one of those carriers, regardless of how that result is reached, only with the approval and authorization of the Commission under this subchapter. In addition to other transactions, each of the following transactions are considered achievements of control or management:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A transaction by a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A transaction by a person affiliated with a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A transaction by at least 2 persons acting together (one of whom is a carrier or is affiliated with a carrier) has the effect of putting those persons and carriers and persons affiliated with any of them, or with any of those affiliated carriers, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A person is affiliated with a carrier under this subchapter if, because of the relationship between that person and a carrier, it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of another carrier, control of which may be acquired by that person, will be managed in the interest of the other carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Approval and authorization by the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are motor carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and the aggregate gross operating revenues of those carriers were not more than $2,000,000 during a period of 12 consecutive months ending not more than 6 months before the date of the agreement of the parties covering the transaction. However, the approval and authorization of the Commission is required when a motor carrier that is controlled by or affiliated with a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is a party to the transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The approval and authorization of the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are street, suburban, or interurban electric railways that are not controlled by or under common control with a carrier that is operated as part of a general railroad system of transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding any provisions of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in a matter related to a motor carrier of property providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, may exempt a person, class of persons, transaction, or class of transactions from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter if the Commission finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application of such provisions is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) either (i) the transaction is of limited scope, or (ii) the application of such provisions is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) At least 60 days before any transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter may take effect, each carrier intending to participate in such transaction shall file with the Commission a notice of its intention to participate in such transaction and shall give public notice of such intention. The Commission shall prescribe the information to be contained in such notices, including the nature and scope of the transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission, on its own initiative or on complaint, may revoke an exemption granted under this subsection, to the extent it specifies, when it finds that application of the provisions of this section to the person, class of persons, or transportation is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Commission, on its own initiative, finds that employees of any carrier intending to participate in a transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter are or will be adversely affected by such transaction or if employees of such carrier adversely affected by such transaction file a complaint concerning such transaction with the Commission, the Commission shall revoke such exemption to the extent the Commission deems necessary to review and address the adverse effects on such employees.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11344 &#183; Consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control: general procedure and conditions of approval</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to approve and authorize a transaction referred to in section 11343 of this title on application of the person seeking that authority. When an application is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall notify the chief executive officer of each State in which property of the carriers involved in the proposed transaction is located and shall notify those carriers. If a motor carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title is involved in the transaction, the Commission must notify the persons specified in section 10328(b) of this title. The Commission shall hold a public hearing when a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is involved in the transaction unless the Commission determines that a public hearing is not necessary in the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In a proceeding under this section which involves the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) whether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall approve and authorize a transaction under this section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public interest. The Commission may impose conditions governing the transaction. When the transaction contemplates a guaranty or assumption of payment of dividends or of fixed charges or will result in an increase of total fixed charges, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the guaranty, assumption, or increase is consistent with the public interest. When a rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, is an applicant and the transaction involves a motor carrier, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the transaction is consistent with the public interest, will enable the rail carrier to use motor carrier transportation to public advantage in its operations, and will not unreasonably restrain competition. When a rail carrier is involved in the transaction, the Commission may require inclusion of other rail carriers located in the area involved in the transaction if they apply for inclusion and the Commission finds their inclusion to be consistent with the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section which does not involve the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall approve such an application unless it finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as a result of the transaction, there is likely to be substantial lessening of competition, creation of a monopoly, or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in any region of the United States; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the anticompetitive effects of the transaction outweigh the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In making such findings, the Commission shall, with respect to any application that is part of a plan or proposal developed under section 333(a)&#8211;(d) of this title, accord substantial weight to any recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to any proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) A rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, together with one or more affected shippers, may apply for approval under this subsection of a transaction for the purpose of providing motor carrier transportation prior or subsequent to rail transportation to serve inadequately served shippers located on a railroad other than the applicant carrier. Such application shall be approved by the Commission if the applicants demonstrate presently impaired rail service and inadequate motor common carrier service which results in the serious failure of the rail carrier serving the shippers to meet the rail equipment or transportation schedules of shippers or seriously to fail otherwise to provide adequate normal rail services required by shippers and which shippers would reasonably expect the rail carrier to provide. The Commission shall approve or disapprove applications under this subsection within 30 days after receipt of such application. The Commission shall approve applications which are not protested by interested parties within 30 days following receipt of such application.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11361 &#183; Scope of authority: changes in financial structure</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission to act under this subchapter is exclusive. The Commission may approve and authorize a carrier, as defined in section 11301(a)(1) of this title, to change (1) a part of a class of its securities, as defined in section 11301(a)(2) of this title, or (2) a part of an instrument under which a class of its securities is issued or a class of its obligations is secured. When a change is approved and authorized by the Commission under this subchapter, the carrier may carry out the change notwithstanding an express provision in the affected instrument or a State law and without getting other approval from the Commission or from a State authority. A person participating in carrying out a change that is approved and authorized under this subchapter is exempt from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the change.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may not approve an application filed under this section by a carrier that is in equity receivership or reorganization under subchapter IV of chapter 11 of title 11.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A power granted to a carrier under this subchapter changes its powers under its corporate charter and under State law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) This subchapter does not affect the negotiability of a security of a carrier or of the obligation of a carrier that assumed liability related to a security. This subchapter does not apply to an equipment-trust certificate under which a carrier is obligated, to an evidence of indebtedness of a carrier the payment of which is secured solely by equipment, or to another instrument under which that equipment-trust certificate or evidence of indebtedness was issued or by which either of them is secured.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11362 &#183; Criteria for approval and authority</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A carrier may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval and authority to make a change under this subchapter. To approve a proposed change, the Commission must find that the proposed change&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is within the scope of section 11361 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will be in the public interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will be in the best interests of the carrier, of each class of its stockholders, and of the holders of each class of the carrier's obligations that are affected by the change; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will not be against the interests of a creditor of the carrier who is not affected by the change.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If the change involves an issuance of securities, the Commission must also make the findings required under section 11301(d)(1) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall begin a proceeding under this section on receipt of an application but may require an applicant to get assurances of assent to the change from the holders of the outstanding shares of the securities that will be affected by the change before continuing with the proceeding. The Commission may determine the percentage of the principal amount or number of those shares needed to establish assurance of assent to the change. A class of securities is considered to be affected by a proposed change only if the change is proposed to a part of that class or to a part of an instrument under which that class was issued or by which it is secured. However, if a proposed change is to an instrument under which at least 2 classes of securities were issued and are outstanding or secured by that instrument, only those classes to which the change is related are considered to be affected. The Commission shall divide the securities to be affected by a proposed change under this subchapter into reasonable classes for purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section the Commission shall notify, and file a copy of the application with, the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The carrier must give notice of the proceeding to the holders of the class of securities affected. The Commission may direct the carrier to give notice to other persons the Commission determines to have an interest in the proceeding. The carrier may give notice under this subsection only after it gets assurances of assent when they are required under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may impose conditions governing the proposed change. The Commission may determine the effective date for a change it approves and authorizes under this subchapter and may allow it to become effective on publication of a declaration to that effect by the carrier. After an application is approved, the Commission may change a condition imposed and impose supplemental requirements for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11363 &#183; Assent of holders of securities and certain other instruments</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) After making the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title, the Commission may approve and authorize the change if it is assented to by the holders of at least 75 percent of the aggregate principal amount or number of outstanding shares of each class of securities affected by the change. The Commission may increase the percentage required for assent under this subsection for a class of shares when an increase is in the public interest and&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 75 percent of the shares in that class are held by less than 25 security holders; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that class is entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier and the Commission determines that the assent of at least 25 percent of the security holders of that class are controlled by the carrier or a person controlling the carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The carrier may withdraw its application after the Commission makes the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title. If the application is not withdrawn, the Commission must require the carrier to submit the proposed change, with conditions imposed by the Commission, to the holders of each class of its securities affected by the change for their assent or rejection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In determining the percentage of outstanding securities when making a finding under section 11362(a) of this title, a security that secures an evidence of indebtedness of the carrier or of a company controlling or controlled by the carrier is considered to be outstanding unless the Commission determines that the proposed change does not materially affect the interest of the holder of that evidence of indebtedness. When that security is considered to be outstanding, assent to a proposed change may be given, notwithstanding another instrument, only&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the security is pledged as security under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued and is outstanding, by the holder of a majority of the principal amount of the evidence of indebtedness; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the security secures an evidence of indebtedness not issued under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued, by the holder of the evidence of indebtedness.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to a submission required under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall require the carrier to submit a proposed change to a security referred to in this subsection, with requirements imposed by the Commission, to the holder of the evidence of indebtedness referred to in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection as appropriate, for assent or rejection. A carrier is not required to submit the change to the trustee of the instrument referred to in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the Commission determines that the assent of the holder of a security not entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier or an evidence of indebtedness is in the control of the carrier or of a person controlling the carrier, that security or evidence of indebtedness is not considered to be outstanding.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11364 &#183; Procedure</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Commission may prescribe the manner in which assents, assurances of assent, or rejections of the security holders may be solicited whether the solicitation is made before or after the Commission approves and authorizes the proposed change.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may approve a bank or trust company, incorporated under the law of the United States or a State, that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has a capital and surplus of at least $2,000,000, to receive assents and revocations of assents from security holders. The Commission may require the security holders to send those assents and revocations to that bank or trust company. That bank or trust company shall certify the result of the submission to the Commission. The Commission may rely on that certification as conclusive evidence in determining the result of that submission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a change becomes effective under this subchapter, the change is binding on, and changes the rights of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) each holder of a security of the carrier of each class affected by the change; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a trustee or other party to an instrument under which a class of securities has been issued or by which it is secured.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) An authorization and approval of a change under this subchapter is authority for, and approval of, a corresponding change of the obligation of another carrier that assumed liability related to that class of securities if that carrier consents to the change in writing. When consent is given, the corresponding change becomes effective when the change of the class of securities or instrument becomes binding. A person who is liable or obligated on a class of securities issued by a carrier is a carrier with respect to that class for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

Section 5 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 77e) does not apply to the issuance, sale, or exchange of certificates of deposit representing securities of, or claims against, a carrier that are issued by committees in proceedings under this subchapter.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier files with an appropriate State authority a change in an intrastate rate, or a change in a classification, rule, or practice that has the effect of changing an intrastate rate, that adjusts the rate to the rate charged on similar traffic moving in interstate or foreign commerce; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) General Rule.&#8212;The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and providing transportation in that State, register the certificate or permit issued to the carrier under section 10922 or 10923 of this title is not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred to in section 10521(a)(1) and (2) of this title when the registration is completed under standards of the Commission under subsection (c) of this section. When a State registration requirement imposes obligations in excess of the standards, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Single State Registration System.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the Commission shall prescribe amendments to the standards existing as of such date of enactment.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Specific requirements.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Evidence of certificate; proof of insurance; payment of fees.&#8212;Under the amended standards implementing the single State registration system described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, only a State acting in its capacity as registration State under such single State system may require a motor carrier holding a certificate or permit issued under this subtitle&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to file and maintain evidence of such certificate or permit;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to file satisfactory proof of required insurance or qualification as a self-insurer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to pay directly to such State fee amounts in accordance with the fee system established under subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph, subject to allocation of fee revenues among all States in which the carrier operates and which participate in the single State registration system; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall require that copies of the receipt issued under clause (i) of this subparagraph be kept in each of the carrier's commercial motor vehicles;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not require decals, stamps, cab cards, or any other means of registering or identifying specific vehicles operated by the carrier;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) shall establish a fee system for the filing of proof of insurance as provided under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph that (I) will be based on the number of commercial motor vehicles the carrier operates in a State and on the number of States in which the carrier operates, (II) will minimize the costs of complying with the registration system, and (III) will result in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) shall not authorize the charging or collection of any fee for filing and maintaining a certificate or permit under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Prohibited fees.&#8212;The charging or collection of any fee under this section that is not in accordance with the fee system established under subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph shall be deemed to be a burden on interstate commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Limitation on participation by states.&#8212;Only a State which, as of January 1, 1991, charged or collected a fee for a vehicle identification stamp or number under part 1023 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be eligible to participate as a registration State under this subsection or to receive any fee revenue under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Effective date of amendments.&#8212;Amendments prescribed under this subsection shall take effect by January 1, 1994.</p>

The complaint must state the facts that are the subject of the violation and, if it is against a water carrier, must be made under oath. The Commission may dismiss a complaint it determines does not state reasonable grounds for investigation and action. However, the Commission may not dismiss a complaint made against a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11705 &#183; Rights and remedies of persons injured by certain carriers</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A person injured because a carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder does not obey an order of the Commission, except an order for the payment of money, may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder is liable to a person for amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for transportation or service contained in a tariff filed under subchapter IV of chapter 107 of this title or the applicable freight forwarder rate, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier in violation of this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or IV of chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder is liable for damages resulting from the imposition of rates for transportation or service the Commission finds to be in violation of this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A person may file a complaint with the Commission under section 11701(b) of this title or bring a civil action under subsection (b) (1) or (2) of this section to enforce liability against a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title. A person may begin a proceeding under section 10704 or 10705 of this title to enforce liability under subsection (b)(3) of this section by filing a complaint with the Commission under section 11701(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Commission makes an award under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall order the carrier to pay the amount awarded by a specific date. The Commission may order a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title to pay damages only when the proceeding is on complaint. The person for whose benefit an order of the Commission requiring the payment of money is made may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this paragraph if the carrier does not pay the amount awarded by the date payment was ordered to be made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) When a person begins a civil action under subsection (b) of this section to enforce an order of the Commission requiring the payment of damages by a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title, the text of the order of the Commission must be included in the complaint. In addition to the district courts of the United States, a State court of general jurisdiction having jurisdiction of the parties has jurisdiction to enforce an order under this paragraph. The findings and order of the Commission are competent evidence of the facts stated in them. Trial in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this paragraph is in the judicial district (A) in which the plaintiff resides, (B) in which the principal operating office of the carrier is located, (C) if a rail carrier, through which the railroad line of that carrier runs, or (D) if a water carrier, in which a port of call on a route operated by that carrier is located. In a civil action under this paragraph, the plaintiff is liable for only those costs that accrue on an appeal taken by the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) All parties in whose favor the award was made may be joined as plaintiffs in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this subsection and all the carriers that are parties to the order awarding damages may be joined as defendants. Trial in the action is in the judicial district in which any one of the plaintiffs could bring the action against any one of the defendants. Process may be served on a defendant at its principal operating office when that defendant is not in the district in which the action is brought. A judgment ordering recovery may be made in favor of any of those plaintiffs against the defendant found to be liable to that plaintiff.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The district court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee as a part of the damages for which a carrier is found liable under this subsection. The district court shall tax and collect that fee as a part of the costs of the action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) must begin such a civil action within 2 years after the claim accrues if the transportation or service is provided by the carrier in the 1-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) must begin such a civil action within 18 months after the claim accrues if the transportation or service is provided by the carrier after the last day of such 1-year period.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11707 &#183; Liability of common carriers under receipts and bills of lading</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I, II, or IV of chapter 105 of this title and a freight forwarder shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this subtitle. That carrier or freight forwarder and any other common carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or IV are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by (1) the receiving carrier, (2) the delivering carrier, or (3) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading and, except in the case of a freight forwarder, applies to property reconsigned or diverted under a tariff filed under subchapter IV of chapter 107 of this title. Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a carrier or freight forwarder. A delivering carrier is deemed to be the carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination but does not include a carrier providing only a switching service at the destination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A freight forwarder is both the receiving and delivering carrier. When a freight forwarder provides service and uses a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title to receive property from a consignor, the motor common carrier may execute the bill of lading or shipping receipt for the freight forwarder with its consent. With the consent of the freight forwarder, a motor common carrier may deliver property for a freight forwarder on the freight forwarder's bill of lading, freight bill, or shipping receipt to the consignee named in it, and receipt for the property may be made on the freight forwarder's delivery receipt.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading under subsection (a) of this section or delivering the property for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A common carrier and freight forwarder may not limit or be exempt from liability imposed under subsection (a) of this section except as provided in this subsection. A limitation of liability or of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement in a receipt, bill of lading, contract, rule, or tariff filed with the Commission in violation of this section is void.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If loss or injury to property occurs while it is in the custody of a water carrier, the liability of that carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. The liability of the initial or delivering carrier is the same as the liability of the water carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A common carrier of passengers may limit its liability under its passenger rate for loss or injury of baggage carried on passenger trains, boats, or motor vehicles, or on trains, or boats, or motor vehicles carrying passengers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A common carrier may limit its liability for loss or injury of property transported under section 10730 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be brought against a delivering carrier (other than a rail carrier) in a district court of the United States or in a State court. Trial, if the action is brought in a district court of the United States is in a judicial district, and if in a State court, is in a State, through which the defendant carrier operates a railroad or route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be brought&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the principal place of business of the person bringing the action is located if the delivering carrier operates a railroad or a route through such judicial district, or in the judicial district in which the point of destination is located; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A civil action under this section may be brought in a United States district court or in a State court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In this section, &#8220;judicial district&#8221; means (i) in the case of a United States district court, a judicial district of the United States, and (ii) in the case of a State court, the applicable geographic area over which such court exercises jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) A carrier or freight forwarder may not provide by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the carrier or freight forwarder gives a person written notice that the carrier or freight forwarder has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. For the purposes of this subsection&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier or freight forwarder, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed and provides reasons for such disallowance; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) communications received from a carrier's or freight forwarder's insurer shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed, provides reasons for such disallowance, and informs the claimant that the insurer is acting on behalf of the carrier or freight forwarder.</p>

In a civil action under this subsection, trial is in the judicial district in which the person who violated that section operates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A copy of the complaint in a civil action under subsection (a) of this section shall be served on the Interstate Commerce Commission and a certificate of service must appear in the complaint filed with the court. The Commission may intervene in a civil action under subsection (a) of this section. The Commission may notify the district court in which the action is pending that it intends to consider the matter that is the subject of the complaint in a proceeding before the Commission. When that notice is filed, the court shall stay further action pending disposition of the proceeding before the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) In a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, the court may determine the amount of and award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party. That fee is in addition to costs allowable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A carrier issuing a security or assuming an obligation or liability that is void under section 11301 of this title and its directors, officers, attorneys, and other agents who participate in authorizing, issuing, hypothecating, or selling that security, or in authorizing the assumption of that obligation or liability, are jointly and severally liable for the damages sustained by a person who acquires for value, in good faith, and without notice that the issue or assumption is void (1) that security, or (2) a security under which an assumption or liability is void.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;11711 &#183; Dispute settlement program for household goods carriers</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) One or more motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title who want to establish a program to settle disputes between such carriers and shippers of household goods concerning the transportation of household goods may submit an application for establishing such program to the Commission. Such application shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission may, by regulation, require. The Commission shall review and approve, in accordance with the provisions of this section, each application submitted under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall approve, at least within 45 days of its filing, any application to establish a program for settling disputes concerning the transportation of household goods which meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may investigate at any time the functioning of any program approved under this section and, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, may suspend or revoke its approval for failure to meet the requirements of this section and such regulations as the Commission may issue to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) No program for settling disputes concerning the transportation of household goods may be approved under this section unless the program is a fair and expeditious method for settling such disputes and complies with each of the following requirements and such regulations as the Commission may issue:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The program is designed to prevent a carrier from having any special advantage in any case in which the claimant resides or does business at a place distant from the carrier's principal or other place of business.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The program provides for adequate notice of the availability of such program, including a concise easy-to-read, accurate summary of the program and disclosure of the legal effects of election to utilize the program. Such notice must be given to persons for whom household goods are to be transported by the carrier before such goods are tendered to the carrier for transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Upon request of a shipper, the carrier must promptly provide such forms and other information as are necessary for initiating an action under the program to resolve a dispute.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Each person, authorized pursuant to the program to arbitrate or otherwise settle disputes, must be independent of the parties to the dispute and must be capable, as determined under such regulations as the Commission may issue, to resolve such disputes fairly and expeditiously. The program must ensure that each person chosen to settle the disputes is authorized and able to obtain from the shipper or carrier any material and relevant information to the extent necessary to carry out a fair and expeditious decisionmaking process.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) No fee for instituting a proceeding under the program may be charged the shipper; except that, if the program is binding solely on the carrier, the shipper may be charged a fee of not more than $25 for instituting a proceeding under the program. In any case in which a shipper is charged a fee under this paragraph for instituting a proceeding under the program and such dispute is settled in favor of the shipper, the person settling the dispute must refund such fee to the shipper unless the person settling the dispute determines that such refund is inappropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The program must not require the shipper to agree to utilize the dispute settlement program prior to the time that a dispute arises.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The program may provide for an oral presentation of a dispute concerning transportation of household goods by a party to the dispute (or a party's representative), but such oral presentation may be made only if all parties to the dispute expressly agree to such presentation and the date, time, and location of such presentation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Any person settling a dispute concerning transportation of household goods under the program must, as expeditiously as possible but at least within 60 days of receipt of written notification of the dispute, render a decision based on the information gathered, except that, in any case in which a party to the dispute fails to provide in a timely manner any information concerning such dispute which the person settling the dispute may reasonably require to resolve the dispute, the dispute settler may extend such 60-day period for a reasonable period of time. A decision resolving a dispute may include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances, including repair, replacement, refund, reimbursement for expenses, and compensation for damages.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Materials and information obtained in the course of a decisionmaking process to settle a dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section may not be used to bring an action under section 11910 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the shipper submits a claim to the carrier within 120 days after the date the shipment is delivered or the date the delivery is scheduled, whichever is later;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the shipper prevails in such court action; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) no dispute settlement program approved under this section was available for use by the shipper to resolve the dispute; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a decision resolving the dispute was not rendered under a dispute settlement program approved under this section within the period provided under subsection (b)(8) of this section or an extension of such period under such subsection; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the court proceeding is to enforce a decision rendered under a dispute settlement program approved under this section and is instituted after the period for performance under such decision has elapsed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) In any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title concerning the transportation of household goods by such carrier, such carrier may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees by the court only if the shipper brought such action in bad faith&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after resolution of such dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after institution of a proceeding by the shipper to resolve such dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section but before (A) the period provided under subsection (b)(8) for resolution of such dispute (including, if applicable, an extension of such period under such subsection) ends, and (B) a decision resolving such dispute is rendered under such program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) other information the Secretary requires.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annual certification applies to a safety regulation prescribed or order issued after the date of the certification only if the State authority submits an appropriate certification to provide the necessary investigative and surveillance activities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, after receipt of an annual certification, the Secretary decides the State authority is not complying satisfactorily with the investigative and surveillance activities prescribed under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may reject any part of the certification or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;20153 &#183; Audible warnings at highway-rail grade crossings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Definitions.&#8212;As used in this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &#8220;highway-rail grade crossing&#8221; includes any street or highway crossing over a line of railroad at grade;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &#8220;locomotive horn&#8221; refers to a train-borne audible warning device meeting standards specified by the Secretary of Transportation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &#8220;supplementary safety measure&#8221; refers to a safety system or procedure, provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is determined by the Secretary to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing (e.g., as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel), and that conforms to standards prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure. The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures within the meaning of this subsection: standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad, or traffic signals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Requirement.&#8212;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations requiring that a locomotive horn shall be sounded while each train is approaching and entering upon each public highway-rail grade crossing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Exception.&#8212;(1) In issuing such regulations, the Secretary may except from the requirement to sound the locomotive horn any categories of rail operations or categories of highway-rail grade crossings (by train speed or other factors specified by regulation)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the Secretary determines not to present a significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which use of the locomotive horn as a warning measure is impractical; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for which, in the judgment of the Secretary, supplementary safety measures fully compensate for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to provide for safety and the quiet of communities affected by train operations, the Secretary may specify in such regulations that any supplementary safety measures must be applied to all highway-rail grade crossings within a specified distance along the railroad in order to be excepted from the requirement of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Application for Waiver or Exemption.&#8212;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may not entertain an application for waiver or exemption of the regulations issued under this section unless such application shall have been submitted jointly by the railroad carrier owning, or controlling operations over, the crossing and by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority. The Secretary shall not grant any such application unless, in the judgment of the Secretary, the application demonstrates that the safety of highway users will not be diminished.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Development of Supplementary Safety Measures.&#8212;(1) In order to promote the quiet of communities affected by rail operations and the development of innovative safety measures at highway-rail grade crossings, the Secretary may, in connection with demonstration of proposed new supplementary safety measures, order railroad carriers operating over one or more crossings to cease temporarily the sounding of locomotive horns at such crossings. Any such measures shall have been subject to testing and evaluation and deemed necessary by the Secretary prior to actual use in lieu of the locomotive horn.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may include in regulations issued under this subsection special procedures for approval of new supplementary safety measures meeting the requirements of subsection (c)(1) of this section following successful demonstration of those measures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Specific Rules.&#8212;The Secretary may, by regulation, provide that the following crossings over railroad lines shall be subject, in whole or in part, to the regulations required under this section:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Private highway-rail grade crossings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Pedestrian crossings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Crossings utilized primarily by nonmotorized vehicles and other special vehicles.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Regulations issued under this subsection shall not apply to any location where persons are not authorized to cross the railroad.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Issuance.&#8212;The Secretary shall issue regulations required by this section pertaining to categories of highway-rail grade crossings that in the judgment of the Secretary pose the greatest safety hazard to rail and highway users not later than 24 months following the date of enactment of this section. The Secretary shall issue regulations pertaining to any other categories of crossings not later than 48 months following the date of enactment of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Impact of Regulations.&#8212;The Secretary shall include in regulations prescribed under this section a concise statement of the impact of such regulations with respect to the operation of section 20106 of this title (national uniformity of regulation).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;24101 &#183; Findings, purpose, and goals</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Findings.&#8212;(1) Public convenience and necessity require that Amtrak, to the extent its budget allows, provide modern, cost-efficient, and energy-efficient intercity rail passenger transportation between crowded urban areas and in other areas of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Rail passenger transportation can help alleviate overcrowding of airways and airports and on highways.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A traveler in the United States should have the greatest possible choice of transportation most convenient to the needs of the traveler.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A greater degree of cooperation is necessary among Amtrak, other rail carriers, State, regional, and local governments, the private sector, labor organizations, and suppliers of services and equipment to Amtrak to achieve a performance level sufficient to justify expending public money.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Modern and efficient commuter rail passenger transportation is important to the viability and well-being of major urban areas and to the energy conservation and self-sufficiency goals of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) As a rail passenger transportation entity, Amtrak should be available to operate commuter rail passenger transportation through its subsidiary, Amtrak Commuter, under contract with commuter authorities that do not provide the transportation themselves as part of the governmental function of the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Northeast Corridor is a valuable resource of the United States used by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation and freight transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) Greater coordination between intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation is required.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Purpose.&#8212;By using innovative operating and marketing concepts, Amtrak shall provide intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation that completely develops the potential of modern rail transportation to meet the intercity and commuter passenger transportation needs of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Goals.&#8212;Amtrak shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use its best business judgment in acting to minimize United States Government subsidies, including&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increasing fares;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increasing employee productivity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) minimize Government subsidies by encouraging State, regional, and local governments and the private sector to share the cost of providing rail passenger transportation, including the cost of operating facilities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) carry out strategies to achieve immediately maximum productivity and efficiency consistent with safe and efficient transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) operate Amtrak trains, to the maximum extent feasible, to all station stops within 15 minutes of the time established in public timetables;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) develop transportation on rail corridors subsidized by States and private parties;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) implement schedules based on a systemwide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be achieved with a degree of reliability and passenger comfort;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) encourage rail carriers to assist in improving intercity rail passenger transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) improve generally the performance of Amtrak through comprehensive and systematic operational programs and employee incentives;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) carry out policies that ensure equitable access to the Northeast Corridor by intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) coordinate the uses of the Northeast Corridor, particularly intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) maximize the use of its resources, including the most cost-effective use of employees, facilities, and real property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Minimizing Government Subsidies.&#8212;To carry out subsection (c)(11) of this section, Amtrak is encouraged to make agreements with the private sector and undertake initiatives that are consistent with good business judgment and designed to maximize its revenues and minimize Government subsidies.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;24308 &#183; Use of facilities and providing services to Amtrak</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General Authority.&#8212;(1) Amtrak may make an agreement with a rail carrier or regional transportation authority to use facilities of, and have services provided by, the carrier or authority under terms on which the parties agree. The terms shall include a penalty for untimely performance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the parties cannot agree and if the Interstate Commerce Commission finds it necessary to carry out this part, the Commission shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) order that the facilities be made available and the services provided to Amtrak; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) prescribe reasonable terms and compensation for using the facilities and providing the services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) When prescribing reasonable compensation under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall consider quality of service as a major factor when determining whether, and the extent to which, the amount of compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of using the facilities and providing the services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall decide the dispute not later than 90 days after Amtrak submits the dispute to the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak's right to use the facilities or have the services provided is conditioned on payment of the compensation. If the compensation is not paid promptly, the rail carrier or authority entitled to it may bring an action against Amtrak to recover the amount owed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Amtrak shall seek immediate and appropriate legal remedies to enforce its contract rights when track maintenance on a route over which Amtrak operates falls below the contractual standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Operating During Emergencies.&#8212;To facilitate operation by Amtrak during an emergency, the Commission, on application by Amtrak, shall require a rail carrier to provide facilities immediately during the emergency. The Commission then shall promptly prescribe reasonable terms, including indemnification of the carrier by Amtrak against personal injury risk to which the carrier may be exposed. The rail carrier shall provide the facilities for the duration of the emergency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Preference Over Freight Transportation.&#8212;Except in an emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless the Secretary of Transportation orders otherwise under this subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the Secretary for relief. If the Secretary, after an opportunity for a hearing under section 553 of title 5, decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Secretary shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on reasonable terms.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Accelerated Speeds.&#8212;If a rail carrier refuses to allow accelerated speeds on trains operated by or for Amtrak, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to allow the accelerated speeds. The Secretary shall decide whether accelerated speeds are unsafe or impracticable and which improvements would be required to make accelerated speeds safe and practicable. After an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary shall establish the maximum allowable speeds of Amtrak trains on terms the Secretary decides are reasonable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Additional Trains.&#8212;(1) When a rail carrier does not agree to provide, or allow Amtrak to provide, for the operation of additional trains over a rail line of the carrier, Amtrak may apply to the Secretary for an order requiring the carrier to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains. After a hearing on the record, the Secretary may order the carrier, within 60 days, to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains on a schedule based on legally permissible operating times. However, if the Secretary decides not to hold a hearing, the Secretary, not later than 30 days after receiving the application, shall publish in the Federal Register the reasons for the decision not to hold the hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when conducting a hearing, whether an order would impair unreasonably freight transportation of the rail carrier, with the carrier having the burden of demonstrating that the additional trains will impair the freight transportation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when establishing scheduled running times, the statutory goal of Amtrak to implement schedules that attain a system-wide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be adhered to with a high degree of reliability and passenger comfort.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Unless the parties have an agreement that establishes the compensation Amtrak will pay the carrier for additional trains provided under an order under this subsection, the Commission shall decide the dispute under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Definitions.&#8212;In this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &#8220;facility&#8221; means a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, facility, or real property related to a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, or facility, including a signal system, passenger station and repair tracks, a station building, a platform, and a related facility, including a water, fuel, steam, electric, and air line.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) downgrading a facility means reducing a track classification as specified in the Federal Railroad Administration track safety standards or altering a facility so that the time required for rail passenger transportation to be provided over the route on which a facility is located may be increased.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Approval Required for Downgrading or Disposal.&#8212;A facility of a rail carrier or regional transportation authority that Amtrak used to provide rail passenger transportation on February 1, 1979, may be downgraded or disposed of only after approval by the Secretary of Transportation under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notification and Analysis.&#8212;(1) A rail carrier intending to downgrade or dispose of a facility Amtrak currently is not using to provide transportation shall notify Amtrak of its intention. If, not later than 60 days after Amtrak receives the notice, Amtrak and the carrier do not agree to retain or maintain the facility or to convey an interest in the facility to Amtrak, the carrier may apply to the Secretary for approval to downgrade or dispose of the facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a rail carrier notifies Amtrak of its intention to downgrade or dispose of a facility, Amtrak shall survey population centers with rail passenger transportation facilities to assist in preparing a valid and timely analysis of the need for the facility and shall update the survey as appropriate. Amtrak also shall maintain a system for collecting information gathered in the survey. The system shall collect the information based on geographic regions and on whether the facility would be part of a short haul or long haul route. The survey should facilitate an analysis of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ridership potential by ascertaining existing and changing travel patterns that would provide maximum efficient rail passenger transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of transportation of competitors or likely competitors;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the likelihood of Amtrak offering transportation at a competitive fare;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunities to target advertising and fares to potential classes of riders;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) economic characteristics of rail passenger transportation related to the facility and the extent to which the characteristics are consistent with sound economic principles of short haul or long haul rail transportation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the feasibility of applying effective internal cost controls to the facility and route served by the facility to improve the ratio of passenger revenue to transportation expenses (excluding maintenance of tracks, structures, and equipment and depreciation).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Approval of Application and Payment of Avoidable Costs.&#8212;(1) If Amtrak does not object to an application not later than 30 days after it is submitted, the Secretary shall approve the application promptly.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If Amtrak objects to an application, the Secretary shall decide by not later than 180 days after the objection those costs the rail carrier may avoid if it does not have to retain or maintain a facility in the condition Amtrak requests. If Amtrak does not agree by not later than 60 days after the decision to pay the carrier these avoidable costs, the Secretary shall approve the application. When deciding whether to pay a carrier the avoidable costs of retaining or maintaining a facility, Amtrak shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the potential importance of restoring rail passenger transportation on the route on which the facility is located;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the market potential of the route;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the availability, adequacy, and energy efficiency of an alternate rail line or alternate mode of transportation to provide passenger transportation to or near the places that would be served by the route;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which major population centers would be served by the route;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the extent to which providing transportation over the route would encourage the expansion of an intercity rail passenger system in the United States; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the possibility of increased ridership on a rail line that connects with the route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Compliance With Other Obligations.&#8212;Downgrading or disposing of a facility under this section does not relieve a rail carrier from complying with its other common carrier or legal obligations related to the facility.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;24311 &#183; Acquiring interests in property by eminent domain</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General Authority.&#8212;(1) To the extent financial resources are available, Amtrak may acquire by eminent domain under subsection (b) of this section interests in property&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, except property of a rail carrier, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a governmental authority; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requested by the Secretary of Transportation in carrying out the Secretary's duty to design and build an intermodal transportation terminal at Union Station in the District of Columbia if the Secretary assures Amtrak that the Secretary will reimburse Amtrak.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak may exercise the power of eminent domain only if it cannot&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquire the interest in the property by contract; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree with the owner on the purchase price for the interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Civil Actions.&#8212;(1) A civil action to acquire an interest in property by eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section must be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the property is located or, if a single piece of property is located in more than one judicial district, in any judicial district in which any piece of the property is located. An interest is condemned and taken by Amtrak for its use when a declaration of taking is filed under this subsection and an amount of money estimated in the declaration to be just compensation for the interest is deposited in the court. The declaration may be filed with the complaint in the action or at any time before judgment. The declaration must contain or be accompanied by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of the public use for which the interest is taken;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the property sufficient to identify it;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement of the interest in the property taken;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a plan showing the interest taken; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a statement of the amount of money Amtrak estimates is just compensation for the interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the declaration is filed and the deposit is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, title to the property vests in Amtrak in fee simple absolute or in the lesser interest shown in the declaration, and the right to the money vests in the person entitled to the money. When the declaration is filed, the court may decide&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the time by which, and the terms under which, possession of the property is given to Amtrak; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the disposition of outstanding charges related to the property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) After a hearing, the court shall make a finding on the amount that is just compensation for the interest in the property and enter judgment awarding that amount and interest on it. The rate of interest is 6 percent a year and is computed on the amount of the award less the amount deposited in the court from the date of taking to the date of payment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) On application of a party, the court may order immediate payment of any part of the amount deposited in the court for the compensation to be awarded. If the award is more than the amount received, the court shall enter judgment against Amtrak for the deficiency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Authority To Condemn Rail Carrier Property Interests.&#8212;(1) If Amtrak and a rail carrier cannot agree on a sale to Amtrak of an interest in property of a rail carrier necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, Amtrak may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order establishing the need of Amtrak for the interest and requiring the carrier to convey the interest on reasonable terms, including just compensation. The need of Amtrak is deemed to be established, and the Commission, after holding an expedited proceeding and not later than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the interest conveyed unless the Commission decides that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conveyance would impair significantly the ability of the carrier to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the obligations of Amtrak to provide modern, efficient, and economical rail passenger transportation can be met adequately by acquiring an interest in other property, either by sale or by exercising its right of eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the amount of compensation is not determined by the date of the Commission's order, the order shall require, as part of the compensation, interest at 6 percent a year from the date prescribed for the conveyance until the compensation is paid.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amtrak subsequently may reconvey to a third party an interest conveyed to Amtrak under this subsection or prior comparable provision of law if the Commission decides that the reconveyance will carry out the purposes of this part, regardless of when the proceeding was brought (including a proceeding pending before a United States court on November 28, 1990).</p>

Amtrak may make such an agreement only after being assured that required labor standards will be maintained on the construction work. Health and safety standards prescribed by the Secretary under section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 333) apply to all construction work performed under such an agreement, except for construction work performed by a rail carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Wage rates in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) are deemed to comply with the Act of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act) (40 U.S.C. 276a&#8212;276a&#8211;5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Contracting Out.&#8212;(1) Amtrak may not contract out work normally performed by an employee in a bargaining unit covered by a contract between a labor organization and Amtrak or a rail carrier that provided intercity rail passenger transportation on October 30, 1970, if contracting out results in the layoff of an employee in the bargaining unit.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;24705 &#183; Additional qualifying routes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Routes Recommended for Discontinuance.&#8212;(1) To maintain a national intercity rail passenger system in the United States and if a reduction in operating expenses can be achieved, Amtrak shall provide rail passenger transportation over each route the Secretary of Transportation recommended be discontinued under section 4 of the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1978 and may restructure a route to serve a major population center as an ending place or principal intermediate place. Transportation over a long distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 7 cents. Transportation over a short distance route shall be maintained if the Amtrak estimate for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, was that the short term avoidable loss for each passenger mile on the route was not more than 9 cents.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For all routes, Amtrak shall calculate short term avoidable loss for each passenger-mile based on consistently defined factors. Calculations shall be based on the most recent available statistics for a 90-day period, except that Amtrak may use historical information adjusted to reflect the most recent available statistics.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Deferral of Secretary's Recommendations.&#8212;(1) To provide equivalent or improved transportation consistent with the goals of section 4(a) of the Act, Amtrak may defer carrying out a recommendation of the Secretary under section 4 of the Act that requires providing transportation over a rail line not used in intercity rail passenger transportation on May 24, 1979, requires using a new facility, or requires making a new labor agreement, until any necessary capital improvements are made in the line or facility or the agreement is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding another law and the route and service criteria, during the period a decision of the Secretary under section 4 of the Act is deferred, Amtrak shall provide substitute transportation over existing routes recommended for restructuring and over other existing feasible routes. Except for transportation concentrating on commuter ridership over a short haul route, transportation provided under this paragraph may be provided only if the route complies with subsection (a) of this section, adjusted to reflect constant 1979 dollars.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Short Haul Demonstration Routes.&#8212;Notwithstanding this part, Amtrak may provide short haul trains on additional routes totaling not more than 200 miles that link at least 2 major metropolitan areas&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on a demonstration basis to establish the feasibility and benefits of the transportation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent available resources allow.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;30120 &#183; Remedies for defects and noncompliance</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Ways To Remedy.&#8212;(1) Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, when notification of a defect or noncompliance is required under section 30118(b) or (c) of this title, the manufacturer of the defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment shall remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge when the vehicle or equipment is presented for remedy. Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall remedy the defect or noncompliance in any of the following ways the manufacturer chooses:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if a vehicle&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by repairing the vehicle;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) by replacing the vehicle with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) by refunding the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if replacement equipment, by repairing the equipment or replacing the equipment with identical or reasonably equivalent equipment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations to allow the manufacturer to impose conditions on the replacement of a motor vehicle or refund of its price.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Tire Remedies.&#8212;(1) A manufacturer of a tire, including an original equipment tire, shall remedy a defective or noncomplying tire if the owner or purchaser presents the tire for remedy not later than 60 days after the later of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the day the owner or purchaser receives notification under section 30119 of this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the manufacturer decides to replace the tire, the day the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement is available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the manufacturer decides to replace the tire and the replacement is not available during the 60-day period, the owner or purchaser must present the tire for remedy during a subsequent 60-day period that begins only after the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement will be available during the subsequent period. If tires are available during the subsequent period, only a tire presented for remedy during that period must be remedied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Adequacy of Repairs.&#8212;(1) If a manufacturer decides to repair a defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment and the repair is not done adequately within a reasonable time, the manufacturer shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) replace the vehicle or equipment without charge with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle or equipment; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for a vehicle, refund the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Failure to repair a motor vehicle or replacement equipment adequately not later than 60 days after its presentation is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. However, the Secretary may extend, by order, the 60-day period if good cause for an extension is shown and the reason is published in the Federal Register before the period ends. Presentation of a vehicle or equipment for repair before the date specified by a manufacturer in a notice under section 30119(a)(5) or 30121(c)(2) of this title is not a presentation under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Filing Manufacturer's Remedy Program.&#8212;A manufacturer shall file with the Secretary a copy of the manufacturer's program under this section for remedying a defect or noncompliance. The Secretary shall make the program available to the public and publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Hearings About Meeting Remedy Requirements.&#8212;On the motion of the Secretary or on application by any interested person, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements under this section. Any interested person may make written and oral presentations of information, views, and arguments on whether the manufacturer has reasonably met the remedy requirements. If the Secretary decides a manufacturer has not reasonably met the remedy requirements, the Secretary shall order the manufacturer to take specified action to meet those requirements and may take any other action authorized under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Fair Reimbursement to Dealers.&#8212;A manufacturer shall pay fair reimbursement to a dealer providing a remedy without charge under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Nonapplication.&#8212;(1) The requirement that a remedy be provided without charge does not apply if the motor vehicle or replacement equipment was bought by the first purchaser more than 8 calendar years, or the tire, including an original equipment tire, was bought by the first purchaser more than 3 calendar years, before notice is given under section 30118(c) of this title or an order is issued under section 30118(b) of this title, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not apply during any period in which enforcement of an order under section 30118(b) of this title is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Exemptions.&#8212;On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary shall exempt the manufacturer from this section if the Secretary decides a defect or noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. The Secretary may take action under this subsection only after notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for any interested person to present information, views, and arguments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Limitation on Sale or Lease.&#8212;(1) If notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title or is required under section 30118(c) of this title and the manufacturer has provided to a dealer notification about a new motor vehicle or new item of replacement equipment in the dealer's possession at the time of notification that contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter, the dealer may sell or lease the motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the defect or noncompliance is remedied as required by this section before delivery under the sale or lease; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title, enforcement of the order is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not prohibit a dealer from offering for sale or lease the vehicle or equipment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Temporary Exemptions.&#8212;(1) On application of a manufacturer, the Secretary of Transportation may exempt, on a temporary basis, motor vehicles of that manufacturer from any requirement under subsections (b) and (c) of this section on terms the Secretary considers appropriate. An exemption may be renewed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may grant an exemption under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Secretary finds that there has been a disruption in the supply of any component of an inflatable restraint or in the use and installation of that component by the manufacturer because of an unavoidable event not under the control of the manufacturer that will prevent the manufacturer from meeting its anticipated production volume of vehicles with those restraints.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Only an affected manufacturer may apply for an exemption. The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe in the amendment to Standard 208 required under this section the information an affected manufacturer must include in its application under this subsection. The manufacturer shall specify in the application the models, lines, and types of vehicles affected. The Secretary may consolidate similar applications from different manufacturers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) An exemption or renewal of an exemption is conditioned on the commitment of the manufacturer to recall the exempted vehicles for installation of the omitted inflatable restraints within a reasonable time that the manufacturer proposes and the Secretary of Transportation approves after the components become available in sufficient quantities to satisfy both anticipated production and recall volume requirements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of Transportation shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of each application under this subsection and each decision to grant or deny a temporary exemption and the reasons for the decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary of Transportation shall require a label for each exempted vehicle that can be removed only after recall and installation of the required inflatable restraint. The Secretary shall require that written notice of the exemption be provided to the dealer and the first purchaser of each exempted vehicle other than for resale, with the notice being provided in a way, and containing the information, the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Application.&#8212;(1) This section revises, but does not replace, Standard 208 as in effect on December 18, 1991, including the amendment of March 26, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 12472), to Standard 208, extending the requirements for automatic crash protection, with incentives for more innovative automatic crash protection, to trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles. This section may not be construed as&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establishing a precedent related to developing or prescribing a Government motor vehicle safety standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section and amendments to Standard 208 made under this section may not be construed as indicating an intention by Congress to affect any liability of a motor vehicle manufacturer under applicable law related to vehicles with or without inflatable restraints.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Report.&#8212;(1) On October 1, 1992, and every 6 months after that date through October 1, 2000, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit reports on the effectiveness of occupant restraint systems expressed as a percentage reduction in fatalities or injuries of restrained occupants compared to unrestrained occupants for&#8212;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;30141 &#183; Importing motor vehicles capable of complying with standards</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General.&#8212;Section 30112(a) of this title does not apply to a motor vehicle if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on petition of a manufacturer or importer registered under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary decides&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the vehicle is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for import into and sale in the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) certified under section 30115 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the same model year (as defined under regulations of the Secretary of Transportation) as the model of the motor vehicle it is being compared to; and</p>

The Secretary of Transportation shall establish the fees for each fiscal year before the beginning of that year. All fees collected remain available until expended without fiscal year limit to the extent provided in advance by appropriation laws. The amounts are only for use by the Secretary of Transportation&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in carrying out this section and sections 30146(a)&#8211;(c)(1), (d), and (e) and 30147(b) of this title; and</p>

A vehicle may not be released if the Secretary gives written notice before the end of the 30-day period that the Secretary will inspect the vehicle under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretaries of Transportation and the Treasury shall prescribe regulations&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Reliance on Manufacturer's Certification.&#8212;In making a certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the registered importer may rely on the manufacturer's certification for the model to which the motor vehicle involved is substantially similar if the importer certifies that any alteration made by the importer did not affect the compliance of the safety features of the vehicle and the importer keeps records verifying the certification for the period the Secretary of Transportation prescribes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Evidence of Compliance.&#8212;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may require that the certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section be accompanied by evidence of compliance the Secretary considers appropriate or may inspect the certified motor vehicle, or both.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;32902 &#183; Average fuel economy standards</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Non-Passenger Automobiles.&#8212;At least 18 months before the beginning of each model year, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation average fuel economy standards for automobiles (except passenger automobiles) manufactured by a manufacturer in that model year. Each standard shall be the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year. The Secretary may prescribe separate standards for different classes of automobiles.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Passenger Automobiles.&#8212;Except as provided in this section, the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a model year after model year 1984 shall be 27.5 miles a gallon.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Amending Passenger Automobile Standards.&#8212;(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations amending the standard under subsection (b) of this section for a model year to a level that the Secretary decides is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for that model year. Section 553 of title 5 applies to a proceeding to amend the standard. However, any interested person may make an oral presentation and a transcript shall be taken of that presentation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an amendment increases the standard above 27.5 miles a gallon or decreases the standard below 26.0 miles a gallon, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit the amendment to Congress. The procedures of section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6421) apply to an amendment, except that the 15 calendar days referred to in section 551(c) and (d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(c), (d)) are deemed to be 60 calendar days, and the 5 calendar days referred to in section 551(f)(4)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6421(f)(4)(A)) are deemed to be 20 calendar days.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that is designed to be installed in or on an automobile (as an addition to, as a replacement for, or through alteration or modification of, any original component, equipment, or other device); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that any manufacturer, dealer, or distributor of the device represents will provide higher fuel economy than would have resulted with the automobile as originally equipped,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">as determined under regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term also includes a fuel additive for use in an automobile.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Examination of Fuel Economy Representations.&#8212;The Federal Trade Commission shall establish a program for systematically examining fuel economy representations made with respect to retrofit devices. Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any representation may be inaccurate, the Commission shall request the Administrator to evaluate, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the retrofit device with respect to which the representation was made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Evaluation of Retrofit Devices.&#8212;(1) On application of any manufacturer of a retrofit device (or prototype of a retrofit device), on request of the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, or on the motion of the Administrator, the Administrator shall evaluate, in accordance with regulations prescribed under subsection (e) of this section, any retrofit device to determine whether the retrofit device increases fuel economy and to determine whether the representations, if any, made with respect to the retrofit device are accurate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator tests, or causes to be tested, any retrofit device on the application of a manufacturer of the device, the manufacturer shall supply, at the manufacturer's expense, one or more samples of the device to the Administrator and shall be liable for the costs of testing incurred by the Administrator. The procedures for testing retrofit devices so supplied may include a requirement for preliminary testing by a qualified independent testing laboratory, at the expense of the manufacturer of the device.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Results of Tests and Publication in Federal Register.&#8212;(1) The Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a summary of the results of all tests conducted under this section, together with the Administrator's conclusions as to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of any retrofit device on fuel economy;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect of the device on emissions of air pollutants; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any other information the Administrator determines to be relevant in evaluating the device.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The summary and conclusions shall also be submitted to the Secretary of Transportation and the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Regulations Establishing Tests and Procedures for Evaluation of Retrofit Devices.&#8212;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations establishing&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) testing and other procedures for evaluating the extent to which retrofit devices affect fuel economy and emissions of air pollutants; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) criteria for evaluating the accuracy of fuel economy representations made with respect to retrofit devices.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;33103 &#183; Theft prevention standard for other lines</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General.&#8212;Not later than October 25, 1994, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe a vehicle theft standard that conforms to the requirements of this chapter for covered major parts that manufacturers install in passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) in not more than 50 percent of the lines not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Extension of Application.&#8212;(1) Not later than 3 years after the standard is prescribed under subsection (a) of this section and based on the finding of the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section to apply the standard, the Secretary shall apply that standard to covered major parts and major replacement parts for covered parts that manufacturers install in the lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not covered by the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include as part of the regulatory proceeding under this subsection the finding of, and the record developed by, the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Initial Review of Effectiveness.&#8212;Before the Secretary begins a regulatory proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall make a finding that the Secretary shall apply the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section unless the Attorney General finds, based on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title and other information the Attorney General develops after providing notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that applying the standard prescribed in subsection (a) to the remaining lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) not covered by that standard would not substantially inhibit chop shop operations and motor vehicle thefts. The Attorney General also shall consider and include in the record additional costs, effectiveness, competition, and available alternative factors. The Attorney General shall submit to the Secretary the finding and record on which the finding is based.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Long Range Review of Effectiveness.&#8212;(1) Not later than December 31, 1999, the Attorney General shall make separate findings, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, on the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this subsection, or both, have been effective in substantially inhibiting the operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the anti-theft devices for which the Secretary has granted exemptions under section 33106 of this title are an effective substitute for parts marking in substantially inhibiting motor vehicle theft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In making the finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the Attorney General shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) base that finding on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) consider the effectiveness, the extent of use, and the extent to which civil and criminal penalties under section 33115(b) of this title and section 2322 of title 18 on chop shops have been effective in substantially inhibiting operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) base that finding on the 3-year and 5-year reports issued by the Secretary under section 33113 of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) base that finding on other information the Attorney General develops and includes in the public record.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall submit a finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection promptly to the Secretary. If the Attorney General finds that the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or both, has not been effective, the Secretary shall issue, not later than 180 days after receiving that finding, an order terminating the standard the Attorney General found was ineffective. The termination is effective for the model year beginning after the order is issued.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making a finding under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives. If the Attorney General finds that the anti-theft devices are an effective substitute, the Secretary shall continue to grant exemptions under section 33106 of this title for the model years after model year 2000 at one of the following levels that the Attorney General decides: at the level authorized before October 25, 1992, or at the level provided in section 33106(b)(2)(C) of this title for model year 2000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Effective Date of Standard.&#8212;A standard prescribed under this section takes effect at least 6 months after the date the standard is prescribed, except that the Secretary may prescribe an earlier effective date if the Secretary&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) decides with good cause that the earlier date is in the public interest; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publishes the reasons for the decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notification of Congress.&#8212;The Secretary and the Attorney General shall inform the appropriate legislative committees of Congress with jurisdiction over this part and section 2322 of title 18 of actions taken or planned under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;33104 &#183; Designation of high theft vehicle lines and parts</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Designation, Nonapplication, Selection, and Procedures.&#8212;(1) For purposes of the standard under section 33102 of this title, the following are high theft lines:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a passenger motor vehicle line determined under subsection (b) of this section to have had a new passenger motor vehicle theft rate in the 2-year period covering calendar years 1990 and 1991 greater than the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts in that 2-year period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a passenger motor vehicle line initially introduced into commerce in the United States after December 31, 1989, that is selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as likely to have a theft rate greater than the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a passenger motor vehicle line having (for existing lines) or likely to have (for new lines) a theft rate below the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph, if the major parts in the vehicles are selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as interchangeable with the majority of the major parts that are subject to the standard and are contained in the motor vehicles of a line described in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standard may not apply to any major part of a line described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection if all the passenger motor vehicles of lines that are, or are likely to be, below the median theft rate, and that contain parts interchangeable with the major parts of the line involved, account (for existing lines), or the Secretary of Transportation determines they are likely to account (for new lines), for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all lines of that manufacturer containing those interchangeable parts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The lines, and the major parts of the passenger motor vehicles in those lines, that are to be subject to the standard may be selected by agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary. If the manufacturer and the Secretary disagree on the selection, the Secretary shall select the lines and parts, after notice to the manufacturer and opportunity for written comment, and subject to the confidentiality requirements of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall prescribe reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection is made at least 6 months before the first applicable model year beginning after the selection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A manufacturer may not be required to comply with the standard under a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection for a model year beginning earlier than 6 months after the date of the selection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) A passenger motor vehicle line subject on October 25, 1992, to parts marking requirements under sections 602 and 603 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92&#8211;513, 86 Stat. 947), as added by section 101(a) of the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&#8211;547, 98 Stat. 2756), continues to be subject to the requirements of this section and section 33102 of this title unless the line is exempted under section 33106 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Determining Theft Rate for Passenger Vehicles.&#8212;(1) In this subsection, &#8220;new passenger motor vehicle thefts&#8221;, when used in reference to a calendar year, means thefts in the United States in that year of passenger motor vehicles with the same model-year designation as that calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under subsection (a) of this section, the theft rate for passenger motor vehicles of a line shall be determined by a fraction&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the numerator of which is the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line during the 2-year period referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the denominator of which is the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of that line (as reported to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under chapter 329 of this title) that are of model years 1990 and 1991 and are distributed for sale in commerce in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under subsection (a) of this section, the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts during that 2-year period is the theft rate midway between the highest and the lowest theft rates determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If there is an even number of theft rates determined under paragraph (2), the median theft rate is the arithmetic average of the 2 adjoining theft rates midway between the highest and the lowest of those theft rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary periodically shall obtain from the most reliable source accurate and timely theft and recovery information and publish the information for review and comment. To the greatest extent possible, the Secretary shall use theft information reported by United States Government, State, and local police. After publication and opportunity for comment, the Secretary shall use the theft information to determine the median theft rate under this subsection. The Secretary and the Director shall take any necessary actions to improve the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the information, including ensuring that vehicles represented as stolen are really stolen.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary periodically (but not more often than once every 2 years) may redetermine and prescribe by regulation the median theft rate under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Providing Information.&#8212;The Secretary by regulation shall require each manufacturer to provide information necessary to select under subsection (a)(3) of this section the high theft lines and the major parts to be subject to the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Application.&#8212;Except as provided in section 33106 of this title, the Secretary may not make the standard inapplicable to a line that has been subject to the standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Sovereignty and Public Right of Transit.&#8212;(1) The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace. To further that right, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board established under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 792) before prescribing a regulation or issuing an order or procedure that will have a significant impact on the accessibility of commercial airports or commercial air transportation for handicapped individuals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Use of Airspace.&#8212;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall develop plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. The Administrator may modify or revoke an assignment when required in the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall prescribe air traffic regulations on the flight of aircraft (including regulations on safe altitudes) for&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) navigating, protecting, and identifying aircraft;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) using the navigable airspace efficiently; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) preventing collision between aircraft, between aircraft and land or water vehicles, and between aircraft and airborne objects.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) To establish security provisions that will encourage and allow maximum use of the navigable airspace by civil aircraft consistent with national security, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish areas in the airspace the Administrator decides are necessary in the interest of national defense; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by regulation or order, restrict or prohibit flight of civil aircraft that the Administrator cannot identify, locate, and control with available facilities in those areas.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the military exception in section 553(a)(1) of title 5, subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 applies to a regulation prescribed under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Foreign Aircraft.&#8212;A foreign aircraft, not part of the armed forces of a foreign country, may be navigated in the United States as provided in section 41703 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Aircraft of Armed Forces of Foreign Countries.&#8212;Aircraft of the armed forces of a foreign country may be navigated in the United States only when authorized by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) No Exclusive Rights at Certain Facilities.&#8212;A person does not have an exclusive right to use an air navigation facility on which Government money has been expended. However, providing services at an airport by only one fixed-based operator is not an exclusive right if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is unreasonably costly, burdensome, or impractical for more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) allowing more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services requires a reduction in space leased under an agreement existing on September 3, 1982, between the operator and the airport.</p>

However, the Secretary may exempt from section 42112(b)(1) and (2) an air carrier not providing scheduled air transportation, and the operations conducted during daylight hours by an air carrier providing scheduled air transportation, when the Secretary decides that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) because of the limited extent of, or unusual circumstances affecting, the operation of the air carrier, the enforcement of section 42112(b)(1) and (2) of this title is or would be an unreasonable burden on the air carrier that would obstruct its development and prevent it from beginning or continuing operations; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may limit the number or location of places that may be served by an air carrier providing transportation only in Alaska under an exemption from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, or the frequency with which the transportation may be provided, only when the Secretary decides that providing the transportation substantially impairs the ability of an air carrier holding a certificate issued by the Secretary to provide its authorized transportation, including the minimum transportation requirement for Alaska specified under section 41732(b)(1)(B) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Emergency Air Transportation by Foreign Air Carriers.&#8212;(1) To the extent that the Secretary decides an exemption is in the public interest, the Secretary may exempt by order a foreign air carrier from the requirements and limitations of this part for not more than 30 days to allow the foreign air carrier to carry passengers or cargo in interstate air transportation in certain markets if the Secretary finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) granting the exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in a labor dispute where the inability to accommodate traffic in a market is a result of the dispute.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary grants an exemption to a foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that air transportation that the foreign air carrier provides under the exemption is made available on reasonable terms;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) monitor continuously the passenger load factor of air carriers in the market that hold certificates under section 41102 of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) review the exemption at least every 30 days to ensure that the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption still exist.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may renew an exemption (including renewals) under this subsection for not more than 30 days. An exemption may continue for not more than 5 days after the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption cease.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Considerations.&#8212;When making a contract under this section, the Administrator shall be guided by the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The part of the cost of a plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance may not be more than the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life (instead of physical life) of the plant or equipment, considering the location and specialized nature of the plant or equipment, obsolescence, and other similar factors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Administrator shall consider the desirability of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period of not more than 3 years, at a price that does not include charges for nonrecurring costs already amortized; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain a negotiated priced option for varying the number of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If feasible and practicable, an advance procurement contract may be made to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Cancellation Payment and Notice of Cancellation Ceiling.&#8212;(1) If a contract under this section provides that performance is subject to an appropriation being made, it also may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if the appropriation is not made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before awarding a contract under this section containing a cancellation ceiling of more than $100,000,000, the Administrator shall give written notice of the proposed contract and cancellation ceiling to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Cancellation and Rejection.&#8212;(1) On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on a complaint filed with the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether a price for foreign air transportation contained in an existing or newly filed tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price, or the value of the transportation provided under that price, is lawful. The Secretary may begin the hearing at once and without an answer or another formal pleading by the air carrier or foreign air carrier, but only after reasonable notice. If, after the hearing, the Secretary decides that the price, classification, rule, or practice is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory, the Secretary may cancel or reject the tariff and prevent the use of the price, classification, rule, or practice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) With or without a hearing, the Secretary may cancel or reject an existing or newly filed tariff of a foreign air carrier and prevent the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the Secretary decides that the cancellation or rejection is in the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to cancel or reject a tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the price on the movement of traffic;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation by air carriers and foreign air carriers at the lowest cost consistent with providing the transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the standards prescribed under law related to the character and quality of transportation to be provided by air carriers and foreign air carriers;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inherent advantages of transportation by aircraft;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) whether the price will be predatory or tend to monopolize competition among air carriers and foreign air carriers in foreign air transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) reasonably estimated or foreseeable future costs and revenues for the air carrier or foreign air carrier for a reasonably limited future period during which the price would be in effect; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Effective Tariffs and Prices When Tariff Is Suspended, Canceled, or Rejected.&#8212;(1) If a tariff is suspended pending the outcome of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary does not take final action in the proceeding during the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect at the end of that period subject to cancellation when the proceeding is concluded.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During the period of suspension, or after the cancellation or rejection, of a newly filed tariff (including a tariff that has gone into effect provisionally), the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier shall maintain in effect and use&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may suspend any existing tariff of a foreign air carrier providing transportation between the United States and the foreign country for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date of the suspension; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may order the foreign air carrier to charge, during the suspension periods, prices that are the same as those contained in a tariff (designated by the Secretary) of an air carrier filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign air carrier may continue to provide foreign air transportation to the foreign country only if the government or aeronautical authority of the foreign country allows an air carrier to start or continue foreign air transportation to the foreign country at the prices designated by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Standard Foreign Fare Level.&#8212;(1)(A) In this subsection, &#8220;standard foreign fare level&#8221; means&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least once every 60 days for fuel costs, and at least once every 180 days for other costs, the Secretary shall adjust the standard foreign fare level for the particular foreign air transportation to which the standard foreign fare level applies by increasing or decreasing that level by the percentage change from the last previous period in the actual operating cost for each available seat-mile. In adjusting a standard foreign fare level, the Secretary may not make an adjustment to costs actually incurred. In establishing a standard foreign fare level and making adjustments in the level under this paragraph, the Secretary may use all relevant or appropriate information reasonably available to the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not decide that a proposed fare for foreign air transportation is unreasonable on the basis that the fare is too low or too high if the proposed fare is neither more than 5 percent higher nor 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level for the same or essentially similar class of transportation. The Secretary by regulation may increase the 50 percent specified in this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply to a proposed fare that is not more than&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 5 percent higher than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be unreasonably discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is in the public interest because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be predatory or discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is required because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Submission of Orders to President.&#8212;The Secretary shall submit to the President an order made under this section suspending, canceling, or rejecting a price for foreign air transportation, and an order rescinding the effectiveness of such an order, before publishing the order. Not later than 10 days after its submission, the President may disapprove the order on finding disapproval is necessary for United States foreign policy or national defense reasons.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Compliance as Condition of Certificate or Permit.&#8212;This section and compliance with an order of the Secretary under this section are conditions to any certificate or permit held by an air carrier or foreign air carrier. An air carrier or foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only as long as the carrier maintains prices for that transportation that comply with this section and orders of the Secretary under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Decisions Not Made Before October 1, 1988.&#8212;(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Review.&#8212;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place. Based on the review and consultations with an interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of service.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;41734 &#183; Ending, suspending, and reducing basic essential air service</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notice Required.&#8212;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&#8217; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Continuation of Service for 30 Days After Notice Period.&#8212;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Continuation of Service for Additional 30-Day Periods.&#8212;If at the end of the 30-day period under subsection (b) of this section the Secretary decides another air carrier will not provide basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing service to continue to provide service for additional 30-day periods until another carrier begins providing service on a continuing basis. At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Continuation of Compensation After Notice Period.&#8212;If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall continue to pay that compensation after the last day of that period. The Secretary shall pay the compensation until the Secretary finds another carrier to provide the service to the place or the 90th day after the end of that notice period, whichever is earlier. If, after the 90th day after the end of the 90-day notice period, the Secretary has not found another carrier to provide the service, the carrier required to continue to provide that service shall receive compensation sufficient&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Compensation to Air Carriers Originally Providing Service Without Compensation.&#8212;If the Secretary requires an air carrier providing basic essential air service to an eligible place without compensation under section 41733 of this title to continue providing that service after the 90-day notice period required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide the carrier with compensation after the end of the 90-day notice period that is sufficient&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Finding Replacement Carriers.&#8212;When the Secretary requires an air carrier to continue to provide basic essential air service to an eligible place, the Secretary shall continue to make every effort to find another carrier to provide at least that basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Transfer of Authority.&#8212;If an air carrier, providing basic essential air service under section 41733 of this title between an eligible place and an airport at which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration limits the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and landings of aircraft, provides notice under subsection (a) of this section of an intention to end, suspend, or reduce that service and another carrier is found to provide the service, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to transfer any operational authority the carrier has to land or take off at that airport related to the service to the eligible place to the carrier that will provide the service, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier that will provide the service needs the authority; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to be transferred is being used to provide air service to another eligible place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Nonconsideration of Slot Availability.&#8212;In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.</p>

<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter I&#8212;Airport Improvement</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;47101 &#183; Policies</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General.&#8212;It is the policy of the United States&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the safe operation of the airport and airway system is the highest aviation priority;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that aviation facilities be constructed and operated to minimize current and projected noise impact on nearby communities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to give special emphasis to developing reliever airports;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that appropriate provisions should be made to make the development and enhancement of cargo hub airports easier;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage the development of transportation systems that use various modes of transportation in a way that will serve the States and local communities efficiently and effectively;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) that airport development projects under this subchapter provide for the protection and enhancement of natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure that nonaviation usage of the navigable airspace be accommodated but not allowed to decrease the safety and capacity of the airspace and airport system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) that artificial restrictions on airport capacity&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are not in the public interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) should be imposed to alleviate air traffic delays only after other reasonably available and less burdensome alternatives have been tried; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) should not discriminate unjustly between categories and classes of aircraft;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) that special emphasis should be placed on converting appropriate former military air bases to civil use and identifying and improving additional joint-use facilities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology, concepts, and approaches that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system (including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of airport facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability) and to encourage and solicit innovative technology proposals and activities in the expenditure of funding pursuant to this subchapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this subchapter; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) that airports should be as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) National Transportation Policy.&#8212;(1) It is a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal transportation system that transports passengers and property in an efficient manner. The future economic direction of the United States depends on its ability to confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, and the need to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) United States leadership in the world economy, the expanding wealth of the United States, the competitiveness of the industry of the United States, the standard of living, and the quality of life are at stake.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation that transports passengers and property in the most efficient manner. By reducing transportation costs, these intermodal systems will enhance the ability of the industry of the United States to compete in the global marketplace.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) All forms of transportation, including aviation and other transportation systems of the future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) An intermodal transportation system consists of transportation hubs that connect different forms of appropriate transportation and provides users with the most efficient means of transportation and with access to commercial centers, business locations, population centers, and the vast rural areas of the United States, as well as providing links to other forms of transportation and to intercity connections.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Intermodality and flexibility are paramount issues in the process of developing an integrated system that will obtain the optimum yield of United States resources.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) The United States transportation infrastructure must be reshaped to provide the economic underpinnings for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy. The United States can no longer rely on the sheer size of its economy to dominate international economic rivals and must recognize fully that its economy is no longer a separate entity but is part of the global marketplace. The future economic prosperity of the United States depends on its ability to compete in an international marketplace that is teeming with competitors but in which a full one-quarter of the economic activity of the United States takes place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) The United States must make a national commitment to rebuild its infrastructure through development of a national intermodal transportation system. The United States must provide the foundation for its industries to improve productivity and their ability to compete in the global economy with a system that will transport passengers and property in an efficient manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Capacity Expansion and Noise Abatement.&#8212;It is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on aircraft noise. Efforts to increase capacity through any means can have an impact on surrounding communities. Noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Consistency With Air Commerce and Safety Policies.&#8212;Each airport and airway program should be carried out consistently with section 40101(a), (b), (d), and (f) of this title to foster competition, prevent unfair methods of competition in air transportation, maintain essential air transportation, and prevent unjust and discriminatory practices, including as the practices may be applied between categories and classes of aircraft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Adequacy of Navigation Aids and Airport Facilities.&#8212;This subchapter should be carried out to provide adequate navigation aids and airport facilities for places at which scheduled commercial air service is provided. The facilities provided may include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reliever airports; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) heliports designated by the Secretary of Transportation to relieve congestion at commercial service airports by diverting aircraft passengers from fixed-wing aircraft to helicopter carriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Maximum Use of Safety Facilities.&#8212;This subchapter should be carried out consistently with a comprehensive airspace system plan, giving highest priority to commercial service airports, to maximize the use of safety facilities, including installing, operating, and maintaining, to the extent possible with available money and considering other safety needs&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) electronic or visual vertical guidance on each runway;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) grooving or friction treatment of each primary and secondary runway;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) distance-to-go signs for each primary and secondary runway;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a precision approach system, a vertical visual guidance system, and a full approach light system for each primary runway;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a nonprecision instrument approach for each secondary runway;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) runway end identifier lights on each runway that does not have an approach light system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a surface movement radar system at each category III airport;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a taxiway lighting and sign system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) runway edge lighting and marking; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) radar approach coverage for each airport terminal area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Cooperation.&#8212;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate with State and local officials in developing airport plans and programs that are based on overall transportation needs. The airport plans and programs shall be developed in coordination with other transportation planning and considering comprehensive long-range land-use plans and overall social, economic, environmental, system performance, and energy conservation objectives. The process of developing airport plans and programs shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive to the degree appropriate to the complexity of the transportation problems.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Consultation.&#8212;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(6) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about any project included in a project grant application involving the location of an airport or runway, or a major runway extension, that may have a significant effect on&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) natural resources, including fish and wildlife;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) natural, scenic, and recreation assets;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) water and air quality; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) another factor affecting the environment.</p>

However, the revenue resulting during a Hawaiian fiscal year may be used only if the amount of the revenue, plus amounts Hawaii receives in the fiscal year from all other sources for costs Hawaii incurs for operating all airports it operates and for debt service related to capital projects for the airports (including interest and amortization of principal costs), is more than 150 percent of the projected costs for the fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection in a Hawaiian fiscal year that Hawaii may use may not be more than the amount that is greater than 150 percent as determined under paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The maximum amount of revenue Hawaii may use under paragraph (2) of this subsection is $250,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Hawaii shall determine costs, revenue, and projected revenue increases referred to in this subsection and shall submit the determinations to the Secretary of Transportation. A determination is approved unless the Secretary disapproves it not later than 30 days after it is submitted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Hawaii is not eligible for a grant under section 47115 of this title in a fiscal year in which Hawaii uses under paragraph (2) of this subsection revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2). Hawaii shall repay amounts it receives in a fiscal year under a grant it is not eligible to receive because of this paragraph to the Secretary of Transportation for deposit in the discretionary fund established under section 47115.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) This subsection applies only to revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection from May 5, 1990, through December 30, 1994, and to amounts in the Airport Revenue Fund of Hawaii that are attributable to revenue before May 4, 1990, on sales referred to in paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection from May 5, 1990, through December 30, 1994, may be used under paragraph (2) in any Hawaiian fiscal year, including a Hawaiian fiscal year beginning after December 31, 1994.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish policies and procedures that will assure the prompt and effective enforcement of subsections (a)(13) and (b) of this section and grant assurances made under such subsections. Such policies and procedures shall recognize the exemption provision in subsection (b)(2) of this section and shall respond to the information contained in the reports of the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation on airport revenue diversion and such other relevant information as the Secretary may by law consider.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Revenue diversion.&#8212;Policies and procedures to be established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall prohibit, at a minimum, the diversion of airport revenues (except as authorized under subsection (b) of this section) through&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Administrative safeguards.&#8212;Policies and procedures to be established pursuant to paragraph (1) shall mandate internal controls, auditing requirements, and increased levels of Department of Transportation personnel sufficient to respond fully and promptly to complaints received regarding possible violations of subsections (a)(13) and (b) of this section and grant assurances made under such subsections and to alert the Secretary to such possible violations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General Authority.&#8212;After making a project grant agreement under this subchapter and consulting with the sponsor, the Secretary of Transportation may decide when and in what amounts payments under the agreement will be made. Payments totaling not more than 90 percent of the United States Government's share of the project's estimated allowable costs may be made before the project is completed if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that the total amount expended from the advance payments at any time will not be more than the cost of the airport development work completed on the project at that time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Recovering Payments.&#8212;If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government's share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Payment Deposits.&#8212;A payment under a project grant agreement under this subchapter may be made only to an official or depository designated by the sponsor and authorized by law to receive public money.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Withholding Payments.&#8212;(1) The Secretary may withhold a payment under a grant agreement under this subchapter for more than 180 days after the payment is due only if the Secretary&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifies the sponsor and provides an opportunity for a hearing; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that the sponsor has violated the agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The 180-day period may be extended by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) agreement of the Secretary and the sponsor; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hearing officer if the officer decides an extension is necessary because the sponsor did not follow the schedule the officer established.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person adversely affected by an order of the Secretary withholding a payment may apply for review of the order by filing a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the project is located. The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is served on the petitioner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Action on Grant Assurances Concerning Airport Revenues.&#8212;If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds a violation of section 47107(b) of this title, as further defined by the Secretary under section 47107(l) of this title, or a violation of an assurance made under section 47107(b) of this title, and the Secretary has provided an opportunity for the airport sponsor to take corrective action to cure such violation, and such corrective action has not been taken within the period of time set by the Secretary, the Secretary shall withhold approval of any new grant application for funds under this chapter, or any proposed modification to an existing grant that would increase the amount of funds made available under this chapter to the airport sponsor, and withhold approval of any new application to impose a fee under section 40117 of this title. Such applications may thereafter be approved only upon a finding by the Secretary that such corrective action as the Secretary requires has been taken to address the violation and that the violation no longer exists.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Judicial Enforcement.&#8212;For any violation of this chapter or any grant assurance made under this chapter, the Secretary may apply to the district court of the United States for any district in which the violation occurred for enforcement. Such court shall have jurisdiction to enforce obedience thereto by a writ of injunction or other process, mandatory or otherwise, restraining any person from further violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Required finding.&#8212;Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after the date of the enactment of this subsection, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)&#160;Minimum Amount To Be Credited.&#8212;(1) In a fiscal year, at least $325,000,000 of the amount made available under section 48103 of this title shall be credited to the fund.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) of this section is less than $325,000,000, the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals $325,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a fiscal year, the total amount available to reduce to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A) and (2) and (d) and 47117(e) of this title.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;47521 &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase in airport capacity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions on aviation that could impede the national air transportation system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a noise policy must be carried out at the national level;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in determining the national interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) community concerns can be alleviated through the use of new technology aircraft and the use of revenues, including those available from passenger facility fees, for noise management;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) revenues controlled by the United States Government can help resolve noise problems and carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) revenues derived from a passenger facility fee may be applied to noise management and increased airport capacity; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a precondition to the establishment and collection of a passenger facility fee is the prescribing by the Secretary of Transportation of a regulation establishing procedures for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on operations of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Surveys, Reports, and Compensation Plans.&#8212;(1) If as a result of an activity carried out under a license issued or transferred under this chapter the total of claims related to one launch is likely to be more than the amount of required insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the Secretary shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not include a resolution that includes more than one compensation plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Senate shall consider under this subsection a compensation plan requiring additional appropriations or legislative authority not later than 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is submitted to Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred immediately to a committee by the President of the Senate. All resolutions related to the same plan shall be referred to the same committee.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;80104 &#183; Form and requirements for negotiation</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General Rules.&#8212;(1) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by indorsement. An indorsement may be made in blank or to a specified person. If the goods are deliverable to the order of a specified person, then the bill must be indorsed by that person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by delivery when the common carrier, under the terms of the bill, undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of a specified person and that person or a subsequent indorsee has indorsed the bill in blank.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by a person possessing the bill, regardless of the way in which the person got possession, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a common carrier, under the terms of the bill, undertakes to deliver the goods to that person; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the bill is negotiated, it is in a form that allows it to be negotiated by delivery.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Validity Not Affected.&#8212;The validity of a negotiation of a bill of lading is not affected by the negotiation having been a breach of duty by the person making the negotiation, or by the owner of the bill having been deprived of possession by fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion, if the person to whom the bill is negotiated, or a person to whom the bill is subsequently negotiated, gives value for the bill in good faith and without notice of the breach of duty, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Negotiation by Seller, Mortgagor, or Pledgor to Person Without Notice.&#8212;When goods for which a negotiable bill of lading has been issued are in a common carrier's possession, and the person to whom the bill has been issued retains possession of the bill after selling, mortgaging, or pledging the goods or bill, the subsequent negotiation of the bill by that person to another person receiving the bill for value, in good faith, and without notice of the prior sale, mortgage, or pledge has the same effect as if the first purchaser of the goods or bill had expressly authorized the subsequent negotiation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;80105 &#183; Title and rights affected by negotiation</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Title.&#8212;When a negotiable bill of lading is negotiated&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the person to whom it is negotiated acquires the title to the goods that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the person negotiating the bill had the ability to convey to a purchaser in good faith for value; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consignor and consignee had the ability to convey to such a purchaser; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the common carrier issuing the bill becomes obligated directly to the person to whom the bill is negotiated to hold possession of the goods under the terms of the bill the same as if the carrier had issued the bill to that person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Superiority of Rights.&#8212;When a negotiable bill of lading is negotiated to a person for value in good faith, that person's right to the goods for which the bill was issued is superior to a seller's lien or to a right to stop the transportation of the goods. This subsection applies whether the negotiation is made before or after the common carrier issuing the bill receives notice of the seller's claim.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;80106 &#183; Transfer without negotiation</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Delivery and Agreement.&#8212;The holder of a bill of lading may transfer the bill without negotiating it by delivery and agreement to transfer title to the bill or to the goods represented by it. Subject to the agreement, the person to whom the bill is transferred has title to the goods against the transferor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Compelling Indorsement.&#8212;When a negotiable bill of lading is transferred for value by delivery without being negotiated and indorsement of the transferor is essential for negotiation, the transferee may compel the transferor to indorse the bill unless a contrary intention appears. The negotiation is effective when the indorsement is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Effect of Notification.&#8212;(1) When a transferee notifies the common carrier that a nonnegotiable bill of lading has been transferred under subsection (a) of this section, the carrier is obligated directly to the transferee for any obligations the carrier owed to the transferor immediately before the notification. However, before the carrier is notified, the transferee's title to the goods and right to acquire the obligations of the carrier may be defeated by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) garnishment, attachment, or execution on the goods by a creditor of the transferor; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notice to the carrier by the transferor or a purchaser from the transferor of a later purchase of the goods from the transferor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A common carrier has been notified under this subsection only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an officer or agent of the carrier, whose actual or apparent authority includes acting on the notification, has been notified; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the officer or agent has had time, exercising reasonable diligence, to communicate with the agent having possession or control of the goods.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General Rule.&#8212;Unless a contrary intention appears, a person negotiating or transferring a bill of lading for value warrants that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the bill is genuine;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person has the right to transfer the bill and the title to the goods described in the bill;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the person does not know of a fact that would affect the validity or worth of the bill; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the goods are merchantable or fit for a particular purpose when merchantability or fitness would have been implied if the agreement of the parties had been to transfer the goods without a bill of lading.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Security for Debt.&#8212;A person holding a bill of lading as security for a debt and in good faith demanding or receiving payment of the debt from another person does not warrant by the demand or receipt&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the genuineness of the bill; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the quantity or quality of the goods described in the bill.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Duplicates.&#8212;A common carrier issuing a bill of lading, on the face of which is the word &#8220;duplicate&#8221; or another word indicating that the bill is not an original bill, is liable the same as a person that represents and warrants that the bill is an accurate copy of an original bill properly issued. The carrier is not otherwise liable under the bill.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Indorser Liability.&#8212;Indorsement of a bill of lading does not make the indorser liable for failure of the common carrier or a previous indorser to fulfill its obligations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) General Rules.&#8212;Except to the extent a common carrier establishes an excuse provided by law, the carrier must deliver goods covered by a bill of lading on demand of the consignee named in a nonnegotiable bill or the holder of a negotiable bill for the goods when the consignee or holder&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) offers in good faith to satisfy the lien of the carrier on the goods;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has possession of the bill and, if a negotiable bill, offers to indorse and give the bill to the carrier; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Persons to Whom Goods May Be Delivered.&#8212;Subject to section 80111 of this title, a common carrier may deliver the goods covered by a bill of lading to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the bill has been indorsed to that person or in blank by the consignee or another indorsee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Common Carrier Claims of Title and Possession.&#8212;A claim by a common carrier that the carrier has title to goods or right to their possession is an excuse for nondelivery of the goods only if the title or right is derived from&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a transfer made by the consignor or consignee after the shipment; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier's lien.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Adverse Claims.&#8212;If a person other than the consignee or the person in possession of a bill of lading claims title to or possession of goods and the common carrier knows of the claim, the carrier is not required to deliver the goods to any claimant until the carrier has had a reasonable time to decide the validity of the adverse claim or to bring a civil action to require all claimants to interplead.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Interpleader.&#8212;If at least 2 persons claim title to or possession of the goods, the common carrier may&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier makes a delivery under section 80110(b)(2) or (3) of this title after being requested by or for a person having title to, or right to possession of, the goods not to make the delivery; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at the time of delivery under section 80110(b)(2) or (3) of this title, the carrier has information it is delivering the goods to a person not entitled to their possession.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Effectiveness of Request or Information.&#8212;A request or information is effective under subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this section only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the officer or agent has had time, exercising reasonable diligence, to stop delivery of the goods.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Failure To Take and Cancel Bills.&#8212;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, if a common carrier delivers goods for which a negotiable bill of lading has been issued without taking and canceling the bill, the carrier is liable for damages for failure to deliver the goods to a person purchasing the bill for value in good faith whether the purchase was before or after delivery and even when delivery was made to the person entitled to the goods. The carrier also is liable under this paragraph if part of the goods are delivered without taking and canceling the bill or plainly noting on the bill that a partial delivery was made and generally describing the goods or the remaining goods kept by the carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Exceptions to Liability.&#8212;A common carrier is not liable for failure to deliver goods to the consignee or owner of the goods or a holder of the bill if&#8212;</p>

A common carrier issuing a bill in violation of this subsection is liable for damages for failure to deliver the goods to a purchaser of one part for value in good faith even though the purchase occurred after the carrier delivered the goods to a holder of one of the other parts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Duplicates.&#8212;When at least 2 negotiable bills of lading are issued in a State for the same goods to be transported to a place in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia, the word &#8220;duplicate&#8221; or another word indicating that the bill is not an original must be put plainly on the face of each bill except the original.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Liability for Nonreceipt and Misdescription.&#8212;Except as provided in this section, a common carrier issuing a bill of lading is liable for damages caused by nonreceipt by the carrier of any part of the goods by the date shown in the bill or by failure of the goods to correspond with the description contained in the bill. The carrier is liable to the owner of goods transported under a nonnegotiable bill (subject to the right of stoppage in transit) or to the holder of a negotiable bill if the owner or holder gave value in good faith relying on the description of the goods in the bill or on the shipment being made on the date shown in the bill.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Nonliability of Carriers.&#8212;A common carrier issuing a bill of lading is not liable under subsection (a) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) when the goods are loaded by the shipper;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when the bill&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) describes the goods in terms of marks or labels, or in a statement about kind, quantity, or condition; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is qualified by &#8220;contents or condition of contents of packages unknown&#8221;, &#8220;said to contain&#8221;, &#8220;shipper's weight, load, and count&#8221;, or words of the same meaning; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent the carrier does not know whether any part of the goods were received or conform to the description.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Liability for Improper Loading.&#8212;A common carrier issuing a bill of lading is not liable for damages caused by improper loading if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the shipper loads the goods; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the bill contains the words &#8220;shipper's weight, load, and count&#8221;, or words of the same meaning indicating the shipper loaded the goods.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Carrier's Duty To Determine Kind, Quantity, and Number.&#8212;(1) When bulk freight is loaded by a shipper that makes available to the common carrier adequate facilities for weighing the freight, the carrier must determine the kind and quantity of the freight within a reasonable time after receiving the written request of the shipper to make the determination. In that situation, inserting the words &#8220;shipper's weight&#8221; or words of the same meaning in the bill of lading has no effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When goods are loaded by a common carrier, the carrier must count the packages of goods, if package freight, and determine the kind and quantity, if bulk freight. In that situation, inserting in the bill of lading or in a notice, receipt, contract, rule, or tariff, the words &#8220;shipper's weight, load, and count&#8221; or words indicating that the shipper described and loaded the goods, has no effect except for freight concealed by packages.</p>

The court also may order payment of reasonable costs and attorney's fees to the carrier. A voluntary surety bond, without court order, is binding on the parties to the bond.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Liability to Holder.&#8212;Delivery of goods under a court order under subsection (a) of this section does not relieve a common carrier from liability to a person to whom the negotiable bill has been or is negotiated for value without notice of the court proceeding or of the delivery of the goods.</p>
