<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be derived by determining the full-time equivalent number of employees performing the activities described in subsection (a) of this section within the Private Radio Bureau, Mass Media Bureau, Common Carrier Bureau, and other offices of the Commission, adjusted to take into account factors that are reasonably related to the benefits provided to the payor of the fee by the Commission's activities, including such factors as service area coverage, shared use versus exclusive use, and other factors that the Commission determines are necessary in the public interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be established at amounts that will result in collection, during each fiscal year, of an amount that can reasonably be expected to equal the amount appropriated for such fiscal year for the performance of the activities described in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) until adjusted or amended by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), be the fees established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees in subsection (g) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mandatory adjustment of schedule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year after fiscal year 1994, the Commission shall, by rule, revise the Schedule of Regulatory Fees by proportionate increases or decreases to reflect, in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), changes in the amount appropriated for the performance of the activities described in subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be adjusted to reflect, within the overall amounts described in appropriations Acts under the authority of paragraph (1)(A), unexpected increases or decreases in the number of licensees or units subject to payment of such fees; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be established at amounts that will result in collection of an aggregate amount of fees pursuant to this section that can reasonably be expected to equal the aggregate amount of fees that are required to be collected by appropriations Acts pursuant to paragraph (1)(B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Increases or decreases in fees made by adjustments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permitted amendments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the adjustments required by paragraph (2), the Commission shall, by regulation, amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees if the Commission determines that the Schedule requires amendment to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1)(A). In making such amendments, the Commission shall add, delete, or reclassify services in the Schedule to reflect additions, deletions, or changes in the nature of its services as a consequence of Commission rulemaking proceedings or changes in law.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dismissal of applications for filings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may dismiss any application or other filing for failure to pay in a timely manner any fee or penalty under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Revocations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to or in lieu of the penalties and dismissals authorized by paragraphs (1) and (2), the Commission may revoke any instrument of authorization held by any entity that has failed to make payment of a regulatory fee assessed pursuant to this section. Such revocation action may be taken by the Commission after notice of the Commission's intent to take such action is sent to the licensee by registered mail, return receipt requested, at the licensee's last known address. The notice will provide the licensee at least 30 days to either pay the fee or show cause why the fee does not apply to the licensee or should otherwise be waived or payment deferred. A hearing is not required under this subsection unless the licensee's response presents a substantial and material question of fact. In any case where a hearing is conducted pursuant to this section, the hearing shall be based on written evidence only, and the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be on the licensee. Unless the licensee substantially prevails in the hearing, the Commission may assess the licensee for the costs of such hearing. Any Commission order adopted pursuant to this subsection shall determine the amount due, if any, and provide the licensee with at least 30 days to pay that amount or have its authorization revoked. No order of revocation under this subsection shall become final until the licensee has exhausted its right to judicial review of such order under section 402(b)(5) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver, reduction, and deferment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may waive, reduce, or defer payment of a fee in any specific instance for good cause shown, where such action would promote the public interest.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit of collections</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Installment payments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such rules and regulations shall permit payment by installments in the case of fees in large amounts, and in the case of fees in small amounts, shall require the payment of the fee in advance for a number of years not to exceed the term of the license held by the payor.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Schedule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Until amended by the Commission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Schedule of Regulatory Fees which the Federal Communications Commission shall, subject to subsection (a)(2) of this section, assess and collect shall be as follows:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Competitive effect to be weighed</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In making the determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Commission shall consider whether forbearance from enforcing the provision or regulation will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such forbearance will enhance competition among providers of telecommunications services.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petition for forbearance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any telecommunications carrier, or class of telecommunications carriers, may submit a petition to the Commission requesting that the Commission exercise the authority granted under this section with respect to that carrier or those carriers, or any service offered by that carrier or carriers. Any such petition shall be deemed granted if the Commission does not deny the petition for failure to meet the requirements for forbearance under subsection (a) of this section within one year after the Commission receives it, unless the one-year period is extended by the Commission.

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Whenever there is filed with the Commission any new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice, the Commission may either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness thereof; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the Commission, upon delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such charge, classification, regulation, or practice, in whole or in part but not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing the Commission may make such order with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after such charge, classification, regulation, or practice had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of the suspension, the proposed new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall go into effect at the end of such period; but in case of a proposed charge for a new service or a revised charge, the Commission may by order require the interested carrier or carriers to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of such charge for a new service or revised charge, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by further order require the interested carrier or carriers to refund, with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such charge for a new service or revised charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any hearing involving a new or revised charge, or a proposed new or revised charge, the burden of proof to show that the new or revised charge, or proposed charge, is just and reasonable shall be upon the carrier, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers for unserved areas</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no common carrier will provide the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of this title to an unserved community or any portion thereof that requests such service, the Commission, with respect to interstate services or an area served by a common carrier to which paragraph (6) applies, or a State commission, with respect to intrastate services, shall determine which common carrier or carriers are best able to provide such service to the requesting unserved community or portion thereof and shall order such carrier or carriers to provide such service for that unserved community or portion thereof.

Prior to permitting a telecommunications carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier to cease providing universal service in an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier, the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall require the remaining eligible telecommunications carrier or carriers to ensure that all customers served by the relinquishing carrier will continue to be served, and shall require sufficient notice to permit the purchase or construction of adequate facilities by any remaining eligible telecommunications carrier. The State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall establish a time, not to exceed one year after the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) approves such relinquishment under this paragraph, within which such purchase or construction shall be completed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &#8220;service area&#8221; means a geographic area established by a State commission (or the Commission under paragraph (6)) for the purpose of determining universal service obligations and support mechanisms.

Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity, the Commission may, with respect to an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated under this paragraph, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the Commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures (including the use of electronic databases, telephone network technologies, special directory markings, industry-based or company-specific &#8220;do not call&#8221; systems, and any other alternatives, individually or in combination) for their effectiveness in protecting such privacy rights, and in terms of their cost and other advantages and disadvantages;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) evaluate the categories of public and private entities that would have the capacity to establish and administer such methods and procedures;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider whether different methods and procedures may apply for local telephone solicitations, such as local telephone solicitations of small businesses or holders of second class mail permits;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consider whether there is a need for additional Commission authority to further restrict telephone solicitations, including those calls exempted under subsection (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a finding is made and supported by the record, propose specific restrictions to the Congress; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) develop proposed regulations to implement the methods and procedures that the Commission determines are most effective and efficient to accomplish the purposes of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall conclude the rulemaking proceeding initiated under paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights described in such paragraph in an efficient, effective, and economic manner and without the imposition of any additional charge to telephone subscribers.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of database permitted</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the establishment and operation of a single national database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that compiled list and parts thereof available for purchase. If the Commission determines to require such a database, such regulations shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specify a method by which the Commission will select an entity to administer such database;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require each common carrier providing telephone exchange service, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to inform subscribers for telephone exchange service of the opportunity to provide notification, in accordance with regulations established under this paragraph, that such subscriber objects to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) specify the methods by which each telephone subscriber shall be informed, by the common carrier that provides local exchange service to that subscriber, of (i) the subscriber's right to give or revoke a notification of an objection under subparagraph (A), and (ii) the methods by which such right may be exercised by the subscriber;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) specify the methods by which such objections shall be collected and added to the database;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) prohibit any residential subscriber from being charged for giving or revoking such notification or for being included in a database compiled under this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring to make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain access to the database, by area code or local exchange prefix, as required to avoid calling the telephone numbers of subscribers included in such database; and (ii) the costs to be recovered from such persons;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) specify the methods for recovering, from persons accessing such database, the costs involved in identifying, collecting, updating, disseminating, and selling, and other activities relating to, the operations of the database that are incurred by the entities carrying out those activities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) specify the frequency with which such database will be updated and specify the method by which such updating will take effect for purposes of compliance with the regulations prescribed under this subsection;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) be designed to enable States to use the database mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of administering or enforcing State law;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) prohibit the use of such database for any purpose other than compliance with the requirements of this section and any such State law and specify methods for protection of the privacy rights of persons whose numbers are included in such database; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) require each common carrier providing services to any person for the purpose of making telephone solicitations to notify such person of the requirements of this section and the regulations thereunder.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Considerations required for use of database method</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines to require the database mechanism described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the database, consider the different needs of telemarketers conducting business on a national, regional, State, or local level;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for recouping the cost of such database that recognizes such differences and&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) reflect the relative costs of providing a national, regional, State, or local list of phone numbers of subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reflect the relative costs of providing such lists on paper or electronic media; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) not place an unreasonable financial burden on small businesses; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers operating on a local basis could be met through special markings of area white pages directories, and (ii) if such directories are needed as an adjunct to database lists prepared by area code and local exchange prefix.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Telephone facsimile machines</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall revise the regulations setting technical and procedural standards for telephone facsimile machines to require that any such machine which is manufactured after one year after December 20, 1991, clearly marks, in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page or on the first page of each transmission, the date and time sent, an identification of the business, other entity, or individual sending the message, and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to put into effect a system of national regulation and review that will oversee interstate pay-per-call services; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;254 &#183; Universal service</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures to review universal service requirements</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal-State Joint Board on universal service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within one month after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall institute and refer to a Federal-State Joint Board under section 410(c) of this title a proceeding to recommend changes to any of its regulations in order to implement sections 214(e) of this title and this section, including the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms and a specific timetable for completion of such recommendations.

Thereafter, the Commission shall complete any proceeding to implement subsequent recommendations from any Joint Board on universal service within one year after receiving such recommendations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Universal service principles</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for the preservation and advancement of universal service on the following principles:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quality and rates</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Quality services should be available at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Access to advanced services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided in all regions of the Nation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Access in rural and high cost areas</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">All providers of telecommunications services should make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">There should be specific, predictable and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Access to advanced telecommunications services for schools, health care, and libraries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services as described in subsection (h) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Additional principles</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such other principles as the Joint Board and the Commission determine are necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent with this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission shall establish periodically under this section, taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services. The Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms shall consider the extent to which such telecommunications services&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are essential to education, public health, or public safety;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are being deployed in public telecommunications networks by telecommunications carriers; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alterations and modifications</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Joint Board may, from time to time, recommend to the Commission modifications in the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the services included in the definition of universal service under paragraph (1), the Commission may designate additional services for such support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and health care providers for the purposes of subsection (h) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service. The Commission may exempt a carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if the carrier's telecommunications activities are limited to such an extent that the level of such carrier's contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service would be de minimis. Any other provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service if the public interest so requires.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Universal service support</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">After the date on which Commission regulations implementing this section take effect, only an eligible telecommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service support. A carrier that receives such support shall use that support only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. Any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission's rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interexchange and interstate services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged by providers of interexchange telecommunications services to subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be no higher than the rates charged by each such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. Such rules shall also require that a provider of interstate interexchange telecommunications services shall provide such services to its subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the rates charged to its subscribers in any other State.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Telecommunications services for certain providers</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall be entitled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the rates for services provided to health care providers for rural areas in a State and the rates for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas in that State treated as a service obligation as a part of its obligation to participate in the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Educational providers and libraries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">All telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal service under subsection (c)(3) of this section, provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties. The discount shall be an amount that the Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to intrastate services, determine is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of such services by such entities. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have an amount equal to the amount of the discount treated as an offset to its obligation to contribute to the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, receive reimbursement utilizing the support mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advanced services</h4>

The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license). Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.

When the Commission has so designated an application for hearing the parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the Commission of such action may acquire the status of a party to the proceeding thereon by filing a petition for intervention showing the basis for their interest not more than thirty days after publication of the hearing issues or any substantial amendment thereto in the Federal Register. Any hearing subsequently held upon such application shall be a full hearing in which the applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate. The burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with respect to any issue presented by a petition to deny or a petition to enlarge the issues, such burdens shall be as determined by the Commission.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Temporary authorization of temporary operations under subsection (b)</h4>

When any such grant of a temporary authorization is made, the Commission shall give expeditious treatment to any timely filed petition to deny such application and to any petition for rehearing of such grant filed under section 405 of this title.</p>

For the purpose of making such determinations, the Commission may, by rule, and notwithstanding any other provision of law&#8212;</p>

To further diversify the ownership of the media of mass communications, an additional significant preference shall be granted to any applicant controlled by a member or members of a minority group.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall have authority to require each qualified applicant seeking a significant preference under subparagraph (A) to submit to the Commission such information as may be necessary to enable the Commission to make a determination regarding whether such applicant shall be granted such preference.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each class of licenses or permits that the Commission grants through the use of a competitive bidding system, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish a competitive bidding methodology. The Commission shall seek to design and test multiple alternative methodologies under appropriate circumstances. The Commission shall, directly or by contract, provide for the design and conduct (for purposes of testing) of competitive bidding using a contingent combinatorial bidding system that permits prospective bidders to bid on combinations or groups of licenses in a single bid and to enter multiple alternative bids within a single bidding round. In identifying classes of licenses and permits to be issued by competitive bidding, in specifying eligibility and other characteristics of such licenses and permits, and in designing the methodologies for use under this subsection, the Commission shall include safeguards to protect the public interest in the use of the spectrum and shall seek to promote the purposes specified in section 151 of this title and the following objectives:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas, without administrative or judicial delays;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promoting economic opportunity and competition and ensuring that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available for commercial use and avoidance of unjust enrichment through the methods employed to award uses of that resource;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) efficient and intensive use of the electromagnetic spectrum;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) ensure that, in the scheduling of any competitive bidding under this subsection, an adequate period is allowed&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) before issuance of bidding rules, to permit notice and comment on proposed auction procedures; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after issuance of bidding rules, to ensure that interested parties have a sufficient time to develop business plans, assess market conditions, and evaluate the availability of equipment for the relevant services; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) for any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)), the recovery of 110 percent of estimated relocation costs as provided to the Commission pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes, consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) require such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed to issue licenses and permits; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prescribe methods by which a reasonable reserve price will be required, or a minimum bid will be established, to obtain any license or permit being assigned pursuant to the competitive bidding, unless the Commission determines that such a reserve price or minimum bid is not in the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall revise the regulations prescribed under paragraph (4)(F) of this subsection to prescribe methods by which the total cash proceeds from any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)) shall at least equal 110 percent of the total estimated relocation costs provided to the Commission pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Conclusion of auctions contingent on minimum proceeds</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall not conclude any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of such Act [47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)] if the total cash proceeds attributable to such spectrum are less than 110 percent of the total estimated relocation costs provided to the Commission pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act. If the Commission is unable to conclude an auction for the foregoing reason, the Commission shall cancel the auction, return within 45 days after the auction cancellation date any deposits from participating bidders held in escrow, and absolve such bidders from any obligation to the United States to bid in any subsequent reauction of such spectrum.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Authority to issue prior to deauthorization</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any auction conducted under the regulations required by subparagraph (A), the Commission may grant a license assigned for the use of eligible frequencies prior to the termination of an eligible Federal entity's authorization. However, the Commission shall condition such license by requiring that the licensee cannot cause harmful interference to such Federal entity until such entity's authorization has been terminated by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Broadcast station renewal procedures</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Standards for renewal</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the licensee of a broadcast station submits an application to the Commission for renewal of such license, the Commission shall grant the application if it finds, with respect to that station, during the preceding term of its license&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the station has served the public interest, convenience, and necessity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of this chapter or the rules and regulations of the Commission; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) there have been no other violations by the licensee of this chapter or the rules and regulations of the Commission which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consequence of failure to meet standard</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any licensee of a broadcast station fails to meet the requirements of this subsection, the Commission may deny the application for renewal in accordance with paragraph (3), or grant such application on terms and conditions as are appropriate, including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standards for denial</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing as provided in subsection (e) of this section, that a licensee has failed to meet the requirements specified in paragraph (1) and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of lesser sanctions, the Commission shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue an order denying the renewal application filed by such licensee under section 308 of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) only thereafter accept and consider such applications for a construction permit as may be filed under section 308 of this title specifying the channel or broadcasting facilities of the former licensee.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Competitor consideration prohibited</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determinations specified in paragraph (1) or (2), the Commission shall not consider whether the public interest, convenience, and necessity might be served by the grant of a license to a person other than the renewal applicant.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(l) Applicability of competitive bidding to pending comparative licensing cases</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">With respect to competing applications for initial licenses or construction permits for commercial radio or television stations that were filed with the Commission before July 1, 1997, the Commission shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have the authority to conduct a competitive bidding proceeding pursuant to subsection (j) of this section to assign such license or permit;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) treat the persons filing such applications as the only persons eligible to be qualified bidders for purposes of such proceeding; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) waive any provisions of its regulations necessary to permit such persons to enter an agreement to procure the removal of a conflict between their applications during the 180-day period beginning on August 5, 1997.</p>

The Commission shall consider in such proceeding the impact that the grant of retransmission consent by television stations may have on the rates for the basic service tier and shall ensure that the regulations prescribed under this subsection do not conflict with the Commission's obligation under section 543(b)(1) of this title to ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable. Such rulemaking proceeding shall be completed within 180 days after October 5, 1992.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The regulations required by subparagraph (A) shall require that television stations, within one year after October 5, 1992, and every three years thereafter, make an election between the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection and the right to signal carriage under section 534 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an originating television station elects under paragraph (3)(B) to exercise its right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection with respect to a cable system, the provisions of section 534 of this title shall not apply to the carriage of the signal of such station by such cable system. If an originating television station elects under paragraph (3)(C) to exercise its right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection with respect to a satellite carrier, section 338 of this title shall not apply to the carriage of the signal of such station by such satellite carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The exercise by a television broadcast station of the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection shall not interfere with or supersede the rights under section 338, 534, or 535 of this title of any station electing to assert the right to signal carriage under that section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the compulsory copyright license established in section 111 of title 17 or as affecting existing or future video programming licensing agreements between broadcasting stations and video programmers.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defenses</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The defenses referred to under subparagraph (A) are the defenses that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the satellite carrier did not retransmit the television broadcast station to any person in the local market of the station during the time period specified in the complaint;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the television broadcast station had, in a writing signed by an officer of the television broadcast station, expressly authorized the retransmission of the station by the satellite carrier to each person in the local market of the television broadcast station to which the satellite carrier made such retransmissions for the entire time period during which it is alleged that a violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section has occurred;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the retransmission was made after January 1, 2002, and the television broadcast station had elected to assert the right to carriage under section 338 of this title as against the satellite carrier for the relevant period; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the station being retransmitted is a noncommercial television broadcast station.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Counting of violations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to each alleged violation, the burden of proof shall be on a television broadcast station to establish that the satellite carrier retransmitted the station to at least one person in the local market of the station on the day in question. The burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Procedures</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall issue procedural regulations implementing this subsection which shall supersede procedures under section 312 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Within 45 days after the filing of a complaint, the Commission shall issue a final determination in any proceeding brought under this subsection. The Commission's final determination shall specify the number of violations committed by the satellite carrier. The Commission shall hear witnesses only if it clearly appears, based on written filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on written filings by the parties.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Discovery</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission may direct the parties to exchange pertinent documents, and if necessary to take prehearing depositions, on such schedule as the Commission may approve, but only if the Commission first determines that such discovery is necessary to resolve a genuine dispute about material facts, consistent with the obligation to make a final determination within 45 days.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Relief</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one person in the local market of such station and has failed to meet its burden of proving one of the defenses under paragraph (4) with respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall be required to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make a finding that the satellite carrier violated subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to that station; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issue an order, within 45 days after the filing of the complaint, containing&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier immediately to stop making any further retransmissions of the television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station until such time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to such station;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the satellite carrier is found to have violated subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to more than two television broadcast stations, a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier to stop making any further retransmission of any television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station, until such time as the Commission, after giving notice to the station, that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to such stations; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an award to the complainant of that complainant's costs and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appeal</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The procedure for an appeal under this paragraph by the satellite carrier shall supersede any other appeal rights under Federal or State law. A United States district court shall be deemed to have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier if the carrier, or a company under common control with the satellite carrier, has delivered television programming by satellite to more than 30 customers in that district during the preceding 4-year period. If the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia does not have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier, an enforcement action or appeal shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which may find personal jurisdiction based on the satellite carrier's ownership of licenses issued by the Commission. An application by a television broadcast station for an order enforcing any cease-and-desist relief granted by the Commission shall be resolved on a highly expedited schedule. No discovery may be conducted by the parties in any such proceeding. The district court shall enforce the Commission order unless the Commission record reflects manifest error and an abuse of discretion by the Commission.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Civil action for statutory damages</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after issuance of an order by the Commission under this subsection, a television broadcast station may file a civil action in any United States district court that has personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier for an award of statutory damages for any violation that the Commission has determined to have been committed by a satellite carrier under this subsection. Such action shall not be subject to transfer under section 1404(a) of title 28. On finding that the satellite carrier has committed one or more violations of subsection (b) of this section, the District Court shall be required to award the television broadcast station statutory damages of $25,000 per violation, in accordance with paragraph (5), and the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the station. Such statutory damages shall be awarded only if the television broadcast station has filed a binding stipulation with the court that such station will donate the full amount in excess of $1,000 of any statutory damage award to the United States Treasury for public purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a station shall incur no tax liability of any kind with respect to any amounts so donated. Discovery may be conducted by the parties in any proceeding under this paragraph only if and to the extent necessary to resolve a genuinely disputed issue of fact concerning one of the defenses under paragraph (4). In any such action, the defenses under paragraph (4) shall be exclusive, and the burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i). A judgment under this paragraph may be enforced in any manner permissible under Federal or State law.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Appeals</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The nonprevailing party before a United States district court may appeal a decision under this subsection to the United States Court of Appeals with jurisdiction over that district court. The Court of Appeals shall not issue any stay of the effectiveness of any decision granting relief against a satellite carrier unless the carrier presents clear and convincing evidence that it is highly likely to prevail on appeal and only after posting a bond for the full amount of any monetary award assessed against it and for such further amount as the Court of Appeals may believe appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appeal</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission denies relief in response to a complaint filed by a television broadcast station under this subsection, the television broadcast station filing the complaint may file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(12) Sunset</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulatory treatment of mobile services</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Common carrier treatment of commercial mobile services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a commercial mobile service shall, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for purposes of this chapter, except for such provisions of subchapter II of this chapter as the Commission may specify by regulation as inapplicable to that service or person. In prescribing or amending any such regulation, the Commission may not specify any provision of section 201, 202, or 208 of this title, and may specify any other provision only if the Commission determines that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations for or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Upon reasonable request of any person providing commercial mobile service, the Commission shall order a common carrier to establish physical connections with such service pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of this title. Except to the extent that the Commission is required to respond to such a request, this subparagraph shall not be construed as a limitation or expansion of the Commission's authority to order interconnection pursuant to this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission shall review competitive market conditions with respect to commercial mobile services and shall include in its annual report an analysis of those conditions. Such analysis shall include an identification of the number of competitors in various commercial mobile services, an analysis of whether or not there is effective competition, an analysis of whether any of such competitors have a dominant share of the market for such services, and a statement of whether additional providers or classes of providers in those services would be likely to enhance competition. As a part of making a determination with respect to the public interest under subparagraph (A)(iii), the Commission shall consider whether the proposed regulation (or amendment thereof) will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such regulation (or amendment) will enhance competition among providers of commercial mobile services. If the Commission determines that such regulation (or amendment) will promote competition among providers of commercial mobile services, such determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that such regulation (or amendment) is in the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Commission shall, not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993, complete a rulemaking required to implement this paragraph with respect to the licensing of personal communications services, including making any determinations required by subparagraph (C).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Non-common carrier treatment of private mobile services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purpose under this chapter. A common carrier (other than a person that was treated as a provider of a private land mobile service prior to August 10, 1993) shall not provide any dispatch service on any frequency allocated for common carrier service, except to the extent such dispatch service is provided on stations licensed in the domestic public land mobile radio service before January 1, 1982. The Commission may by regulation terminate, in whole or in part, the prohibition contained in the preceding sentence if the Commission determines that such termination will serve the public interest.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State preemption</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title, no State or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services. Nothing in this subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services (where such services are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications within such State) from requirements imposed by a State commission on all providers of telecommunications services necessary to ensure the universal availability of telecommunications service at affordable rates. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, a State may petition the Commission for authority to regulate the rates for any commercial mobile service and the Commission shall grant such petition if such State demonstrates that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) market conditions with respect to such services fail to protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such market conditions exist and such service is a replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the telephone land line exchange service within such State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition. If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such periods of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a State has in effect on June 1, 1993, any regulation concerning the rates for any commercial mobile service offered in such State on such date, such State may, no later than 1 year after August 10, 1993, petition the Commission requesting that the State be authorized to continue exercising authority over such rates. If a State files such a petition, the State's existing regulation shall, notwithstanding subparagraph (A), remain in effect until the Commission completes all action (including any reconsideration) on such petition. The Commission shall review such petition in accordance with the procedures established in such subparagraph, shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) within 12 months after such petition is filed, and shall grant such petition if the State satisfies the showing required under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii). If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such period of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. After a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Commission, has elapsed from the issuance of an order under subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph, any interested party may petition the Commission for an order that the exercise of authority by a State pursuant to such subparagraph is no longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile services are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition in whole or in part.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulatory treatment of communications satellite corporation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter or affect the regulatory treatment required by title IV of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 [47 U.S.C. 741 et seq.] of the corporation authorized by title III of such Act [47 U.S.C. 731 et seq.].</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Space segment capacity</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from continuing to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite systems to providers of commercial mobile services shall be treated as common carriage.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Foreign ownership</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission, upon a petition for waiver filed within 6 months after August 10, 1993, may waive the application of section 310(b) of this title to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed before May 24, 1993, of any provider of a private land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, but only upon the following conditions:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The extent of foreign ownership interest shall not be increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such waiver shall not permit the subsequent transfer of ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Preservation of local zoning authority</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The regulation of the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities by any State or local government or instrumentality thereof&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A State or local government or instrumentality thereof shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with such government or instrumentality, taking into account the nature and scope of such request.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Any decision by a State or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission's regulations concerning such emissions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) Any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court shall hear and decide such action on an expedited basis. Any person adversely affected by an act or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with clause (iv) may petition the Commission for relief.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of commercial mobile services, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not be required to provide equal access to common carriers for the provision of telephone toll services. If the Commission determines that subscribers to such services are denied access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&#8217; choice, and that such denial is contrary to the public interest, convenience, and necessity, then the Commission shall prescribe regulations to afford subscribers unblocked access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&#8217; choice through the use of a carrier identification code assigned to such provider or other mechanism. The requirements for unblocking shall not apply to mobile satellite services unless the Commission finds it to be in the public interest to apply such requirements to such services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) A subscriber shall be eligible for a distant digital signal under clause (i)(III) if such subscriber is determined, based on a test conducted in accordance with section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation, not to be able to receive a signal that exceeds the signal intensity standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on December 8, 2004.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) Such test shall be conducted, upon written request for a digital signal strength test by the subscriber to the satellite carrier, within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits such request for the test. Such test shall be conducted by a qualified and independent person selected by the satellite carrier and the network station or stations, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test shall be borne as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) If the subscriber is not eligible for a distant digital signal under clause (i)(I) of this subparagraph (by reason of being outside of the coverage area of the analog signal), the satellite carrier may request the station licensee for a waiver.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) If the licensee agrees to a waiver, or fails to respond to a waiver request within 30 days, the subscriber may receive such distant digital signal.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(cc) If the licensee refuses to grant a waiver, the subscriber may request the satellite carrier to conduct the test.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(dd) If the satellite carrier requests the test and&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(AA) the station's signal is determined to exceed such signal intensity standard, the costs of the test shall be borne by the satellite carrier; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(BB) the station's signal is determined to not exceed such signal intensity standard, the costs of the test shall be borne by the licensee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(ee) If the satellite carrier does not request the test, or fails to respond within 30 days, the subscriber may request the test be conducted under the supervision of the carrier, and the costs of the test shall be borne by the subscriber in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission. Such regulations shall also require the carrier to notify the subscriber of the typical costs of such test.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Trigger events for use of testing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subscriber shall not be eligible for a distant digital signal under clause (i)(III) pursuant to a test conducted under clause (vii) until&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in the case of a subscriber whose household is located within the area predicted to be served (by the predictive model for analog signals under subsection (b)(3) of this section) by the signal of a local network station and who is seeking a distant digital signal of a station affiliated with the same network as that local network station&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) April 30, 2006, if such local network station is within the top 100 television markets and&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-6em">(AA) has received a tentative digital television service channel designation that is the same as such station's current digital television service channel; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-6em">(BB) has been found by the Commission to have lost interference protection; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) July 15, 2007, for any other local network stations, other than translator stations licensed to broadcast on December 8, 2004; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for retransmission</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study of digital strength testing procedures</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Study required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry regarding whether, for purposes of identifying if a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under section 119(d)(10) of title 17, the digital signal strength standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or the testing procedures in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, such statutes or regulations should be revised to take into account the types of antennas that are available to consumers.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Study considerations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In conducting the study under this paragraph, the Commission shall consider whether&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to account for the fact that an antenna can be mounted on a roof or placed in a home and can be fixed or capable of rotating;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, should be amended to create different procedures for determining if the requisite digital signal strength is present than for determining if the requisite analog signal strength is present;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a standard should be used other than the presence of a signal of a certain strength to ensure that a household can receive a high-quality picture using antennas of reasonable cost and ease of installation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to develop a predictive methodology for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under section 119(d)(10) of title 17;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) there is a wide variation in the ability of reasonably priced consumer digital television sets to receive over-the-air signals, such that at a given signal strength some may be able to display high-quality pictures while others cannot, whether such variation is related to the price of the television set, and whether such variation should be factored into setting a standard for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) to account for factors such as building loss, external interference sources, or undesired signals from both digital television and analog television stations using either the same or adjacent channels in nearby markets, foliage, and man-made clutter.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Report</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report containing&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the results of the study under this paragraph; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) recommendations, if any, as to what changes should be made to Federal statutes or regulations.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waivers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A subscriber who is denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119 of title 17 may request a waiver from such denial by submitting a request, through such subscriber's satellite carrier, to the network station asserting that the retransmission is prohibited. The network station shall accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within 30 days after receipt of the request. The subscriber shall be permitted to receive such retransmission under section 119(d)(10)(B) of title 17, if such station agrees to the waiver request and files with the satellite carrier a written waiver with respect to that subscriber allowing the subscriber to receive such retransmission. If a television network station fails to accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within the 30-day period after receipt of the request, that station shall be deemed to agree to the waiver request and have filed such written waiver.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Establishment of improved predictive model required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall take all actions necessary, including any reconsideration, to develop and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations to receive signals in accordance with the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall rely on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by the Federal Communications Commission in Docket No. 98&#8211;201 and ensure that such model takes into account terrain, building structures, and other land cover variations. The Commission shall establish procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the model by the use of additional data as it becomes available.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Objective verification</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a subscriber's request for a waiver under paragraph (2) is rejected and the subscriber submits to the subscriber's satellite carrier a request for a test verifying the subscriber's inability to receive a signal that meets the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited with respect to that subscriber shall select a qualified and independent person to conduct a test in accordance with section 73.686(d) of its regulations (47 CFR 73.686(d)), or any successor regulation. Such test shall be conducted within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits a request for the test. If the written findings and conclusions of a test conducted in accordance with such section (or any successor regulation) demonstrate that the subscriber does not receive a signal that meets or exceeds the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, the subscriber shall not be denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119 of title 17.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Designation of tester and allocation of costs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited are unable to agree on such a person to conduct the test, the person shall be designated by an independent and neutral entity designated by the Commission by rule. Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test under this paragraph shall be borne by the satellite carrier, if the station's signal meets or exceeds the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, or by the network station, if its signal fails to meet or exceed such standard.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Avoidance of undue burden</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Commission regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall seek to avoid any undue burden on any party.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Reduction of verification burdens</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall by rule exempt from the verification requirements of subparagraph (A) any request for a test made by a subscriber to a satellite carrier to whom the retransmission of the signals of local broadcast stations is available under section 338 of this title from such carrier.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A satellite carrier may refuse to engage in the testing process. If the carrier does so refuse, a subscriber in a local market in which the satellite carrier does not offer the signals of local broadcast stations under section 338 of this title may, at his or her own expense, authorize a signal intensity test to be performed pursuant to the procedures specified by the Commission in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by a tester who is approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test. The tester shall give 5 business days advance written notice to the satellite carrier and to the affected network station or stations. A signal intensity test conducted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be determinative of the signal strength received at that household for purposes of determining whether the household is capable of receiving a Grade B intensity signal.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (d)(4) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection, the term &#8220;satellite carrier&#8221; includes a distributor (as defined in section 119(d)(1) of title 17), but only if the satellite distributor's relationship with the subscriber includes billing, collection, service activation, and service deactivation.</p>

No such application shall excuse any person from complying with or obeying any order, decision, report, or action of the Commission, or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof, without the special order of the Commission. The filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not be a condition precedent to judicial review of any such order, decision, report, or action, except where the party seeking such review (1) was not a party to the proceedings resulting in such order, decision, report, or action, or (2) relies on questions of fact or law upon which the Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, has been afforded no opportunity to pass. The Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, shall enter an order, with a concise statement of the reasons therefor, denying a petition for reconsideration or granting such petition, in whole or in part, and ordering such further proceedings as may be appropriate: Provided, That in any case where such petition relates to an instrument of authorization granted without a hearing, the Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, shall take such action within ninety days of the filing of such petition.

If the court finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or finds that the price, terms, or conditions established by the cable operator are unreasonable, the court may order such system to make available to such person the channel capacity sought, and further determine the appropriate price, terms, or conditions for such use consistent with subsection (c) of this section, and may award actual damages if it deems such relief appropriate. In any such action, the court shall not consider any price, term, or condition established between an operator and an affiliate for comparable services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding sections 541(c) and 543(a) of this title, at such time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are available to 70 percent of households within the United States and are subscribed to by 70 percent of the households to which such systems are available, the Commission may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources. Any rules promulgated by the Commission pursuant to this subsection shall not preempt authority expressly granted to franchising authorities under this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cable service unprotected by Constitution</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any cable service offered pursuant to this section shall not be provided, or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable service in the judgment of the franchising authority or the cable operator is obscene, or is in conflict with community standards in that it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States. This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Programming from qualified minority or educational programming sources</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a cable operator required by this section to designate channel capacity for commercial use may use any such channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source, whether or not such source is affiliated with the cable operator. The channel capacity used to provide programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 33 percent of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this section. No programming provided over a cable system on July 1, 1990, may qualify as minority programming or educational programming on that cable system under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;qualified minority programming source&#8221; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to coverage of minority viewpoints, or to programming directed at members of minority groups, and which is over 50 percent minority-owned, as the term &#8220;minority&#8221; is defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &#8220;qualified educational programming source&#8221; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to educational or instructional programming that promotes public understanding of mathematics, the sciences, the humanities, and the arts and has a documented annual expenditure on programming exceeding $15,000,000. The annual expenditure on programming means all annual costs incurred by the programming source to produce or acquire programs which are scheduled to be televised, and specifically excludes marketing, promotion, satellite transmission and operational costs, and general administrative costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall substitute for the requirements to carry qualified noncommercial educational television stations as specified under section 535 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Single channel access to indecent programming</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 120 days following October 5, 1992, the Commission shall promulgate regulations designed to limit the access of children to indecent programming, as defined by Commission regulations, and which cable operators have not voluntarily prohibited under subsection (h) of this section by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requiring cable operators to place on a single channel all indecent programs, as identified by program providers, intended for carriage on channels designated for commercial use under this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requiring cable operators to block such single channel unless the subscriber requests access to such channel in writing; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) requiring programmers to inform cable operators if the program would be indecent as defined by Commission regulations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Cable operators shall comply with the regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;533 &#183; Ownership restrictions</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cable operator holding license for multichannel distribution or offering satellite service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for a cable operator to hold a license for multichannel multipoint distribution service, or to offer satellite master antenna television service separate and apart from any franchised cable service, in any portion of the franchise area served by that cable operator's cable system. The Commission&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall waive the requirements of this paragraph for all existing multichannel multipoint distribution services and satellite master antenna television services which are owned by a cable operator on October 5, 1992;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may waive the requirements of this paragraph to the extent the Commission determines is necessary to ensure that all significant portions of a franchise area are able to obtain video programming; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall not apply the requirements of this subsection to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section 543(l) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Promulgation of rules</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prescribe rules with respect to the ownership or control of cable systems by persons who own or control other media of mass communications which serve the same community served by a cable system.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulation of ownership by States or franchising authorities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any State or franchising authority may not prohibit the ownership or control of a cable system by any person because of such person's ownership or control of any other media of mass communications or other media interests. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State or franchising authority from prohibiting the ownership or control of a cable system in a jurisdiction by any person (1) because of such person's ownership or control of any other cable system in such jurisdiction; or (2) in circumstances in which the State or franchising authority determines that the acquisition of such a cable system may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in such jurisdiction.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Holding of ownership interests or exercise of editorial control by States or franchising authorities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a State or franchising authority may hold any ownership interest in any cable system.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any State or franchising authority shall not exercise any editorial control regarding the content of any cable service on a cable system in which such governmental entity holds ownership interest (other than programming on any channel designated for educational or governmental use), unless such control is exercised through an entity separate from the franchising authority.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enhancement of effective competition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to enhance effective competition, the Commission shall, within one year after October 5, 1992, conduct a proceeding&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through cable systems owned by such person, or in which such person has an attributable interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that can be occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing limitations on the degree to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing rules and regulations under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, among other public interest objectives&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that no cable operator or group of cable operators can unfairly impede, either because of the size of any individual operator or because of joint actions by a group of operators of sufficient size, the flow of video programming from the video programmer to the consumer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that cable operators affiliated with video programmers do not favor such programmers in determining carriage on their cable systems or do not unreasonably restrict the flow of the video programming of such programmers to other video distributors;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take particular account of the market structure, ownership patterns, and other relationships of the cable television industry, including the nature and market power of the local franchise, the joint ownership of cable systems and video programmers, and the various types of non-equity controlling interests;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) account for any efficiencies and other benefits that might be gained through increased ownership or control;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) make such rules and regulations reflect the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) not impose limitations which would bar cable operators from serving previously unserved rural areas; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) not impose limitations which would impair the development of diverse and high quality video programming.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Combination of interests under prior law</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to prohibit any combination of any interests held by any person on July 1, 1984, to the extent of the interests so held as of such date, if the holding of such interests was not inconsistent with any applicable Federal or State law or regulations in effect on that date.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &#8220;Media of mass communications&#8221; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &#8220;media of mass communications&#8221; shall have the meaning given such term under section 309(i)(3)(C)(i) of this title.</p>

<p class="source-credit">June 19, 1934, ch. 652, title VI, &#167;613, as added Pub. L. 98&#8211;549, &#167;2, Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2785; amended Pub.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;534 &#183; Carriage of local commercial television signals</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each cable operator shall carry, on the cable system of that operator, the signals of local commercial television stations and qualified low power stations as provided by this section. Carriage of additional broadcast television signals on such system shall be at the discretion of such operator, subject to section 325(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Signals required</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall carry the signals of at least three local commercial television stations, except that if such a system has 300 or fewer subscribers, it shall not be subject to any requirements under this section so long as such system does not delete from carriage by that system any signal of a broadcast television station.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A cable operator of a cable system with more than 12 usable activated channels shall carry the signals of local commercial television stations, up to one-third of the aggregate number of usable activated channels of such system.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection of signals</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the number of local commercial television stations exceeds the maximum number of signals a cable system is required to carry under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall have discretion in selecting which such stations shall be carried on its cable system, except that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under no circumstances shall a cable operator carry a qualified low power station in lieu of a local commercial television station; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the cable operator elects to carry an affiliate of a broadcast network (as such term is defined by the Commission by regulation), such cable operator shall carry the affiliate of such broadcast network whose city of license reference point, as defined in section 76.53 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulation thereto, is closest to the principal headend of the cable system.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Content to be carried</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator shall carry in its entirety, on the cable system of that operator, the primary video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission of each of the local commercial television stations carried on the cable system and, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the vertical blanking interval or on subcarriers. Retransmission of other material in the vertical blanking internal or other nonprogram-related material (including teletext and other subscription and advertiser-supported information services) shall be at the discretion of the cable operator. Where appropriate and feasible, operators may delete signal enhancements, such as ghost-canceling, from the broadcast signal and employ such enhancements at the system headend or headends.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The cable operator shall carry the entirety of the program schedule of any television station carried on the cable system unless carriage of specific programming is prohibited, and other programming authorized to be substituted, under section 76.67 or subpart F of part 76 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulations thereto.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Signal quality</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nondegradation; technical specifications</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The signals of local commercial television stations that a cable operator carries shall be carried without material degradation. The Commission shall adopt carriage standards to ensure that, to the extent technically feasible, the quality of signal processing and carriage provided by a cable system for the carriage of local commercial television stations will be no less than that provided by the system for carriage of any other type of signal.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Advanced television</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">At such time as the Commission prescribes modifications of the standards for television broadcast signals, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to establish any changes in the signal carriage requirements of cable television systems necessary to ensure cable carriage of such broadcast signals of local commercial television stations which have been changed to conform with such modified standards.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duplication not required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any local commercial television station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station which is carried on its cable system, or to carry the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network (as such term is defined by regulation). If a cable operator elects to carry on its cable system a signal which substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station carried on the cable system, or to carry on its system the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network, all such signals shall be counted toward the number of signals the operator is required to carry under paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Channel positioning</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the local commercial television station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or on the channel on which it was carried on January 1, 1992, at the election of the station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator. Any dispute regarding the positioning of a local commercial television station shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Signal availability</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system. Such signals shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which a cable operator provides a connection. If a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections, but does not provide the subscriber with such connections, or with the equipment and materials for such connections, the operator shall notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable without a converter box and shall offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such subscribers at rates in accordance with section 543(b)(3) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Identification of signals carried</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person, the signals carried on its system in fulfillment of the requirements of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Notification</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall provide written notice to a local commercial television station at least 30 days prior to either deleting from carriage or repositioning that station. No deletion or repositioning of a local commercial television station shall occur during a period in which major television ratings services measure the size of audiences of local television stations. The notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Compensation for carriage</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local commercial television stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for the channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the principal headend of the cable system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator may accept payments from stations which would be considered distant signals under section 111 of title 17 as indemnification for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage of such signal; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a cable operator may continue to accept monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage or channel positioning of the signal of any local commercial television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section, through, but not beyond, the date of expiration of an agreement thereon between a cable operator and a local commercial television station entered into prior to June 26, 1990.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Low power station carriage obligation</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there are not sufficient signals of full power local commercial television stations to fill the channels set aside under subsection (b) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of 35 or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry one qualified low power station; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of more than 35 usable activated channels shall be required to carry two qualified low power stations.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of public, educational, or governmental channels</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator required to carry more than one signal of a qualified low power station under this subsection may do so, subject to approval by the franchising authority pursuant to section 531 of this title, by placing such additional station on public, educational, or governmental channels not in use for their designated purposes.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Remedies</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaints by broadcast stations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a local commercial television station believes that a cable operator has failed to meet its obligations under this section, such station shall notify the operator, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the cable operator is obligated to carry the signal of such station or has otherwise failed to comply with the channel positioning or repositioning or other requirements of this section. The cable operator shall, within 30 days of such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and either commence to carry the signal of such station in accordance with the terms requested or state its reasons for believing that it is not obligated to carry such signal or is in compliance with the channel positioning and repositioning and other requirements of this section. A local commercial television station that is denied carriage or channel positioning or repositioning in accordance with this section by a cable operator may obtain review of such denial by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable operator has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed, the Commission shall determine whether the cable operator has met its obligations under this section. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the cable operator to reposition the complaining station or, in the case of an obligation to carry a station, to commence carriage of the station and to continue such carriage for at least 12 months. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has fully met the requirements of this section, it shall dismiss the complaint.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Input selector switch rules abolished</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No cable operator shall be required&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide or make available any input selector switch as defined in section 76.5(mm) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any comparable device; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide information to subscribers about input selector switches or comparable devices.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations by Commission</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, following a rulemaking proceeding, issue regulations implementing the requirements imposed by this section. Such implementing regulations shall include necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sales presentations and program length commercials</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Carriage pending proceeding</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending the outcome of the proceeding under paragraph (2), nothing in this chapter shall require a cable operator to carry on any tier, or prohibit a cable operator from carrying on any tier, the signal of any commercial television station or video programming service that is predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proceeding concerning certain stations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 270 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission, notwithstanding prior proceedings to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, shall complete a proceeding in accordance with this paragraph to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In conducting such proceeding, the Commission shall provide appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. The Commission shall consider the viewing of such stations, the level of competing demands for the spectrum allocated to such stations, and the role of such stations in providing competition to nonbroadcast services offering similar programming. In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall qualify such stations as local commercial television stations for purposes of subsection (a) of this section. In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are not serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall allow the licensees of such stations a reasonable period within which to provide different programming, and shall not deny such stations a renewal expectancy solely because their programming consisted predominantly of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Definitions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Local commercial television station</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &#8220;local commercial television station&#8221; shall not include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) low power television stations, television translator stations, and passive repeaters which operate pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulations thereto;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a television broadcast station that would be considered a distant signal under section 111 of title 17, if such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage on the cable system; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a television broadcast station that does not deliver to the principal headend of a cable system either a signal level of &#8722;45dBm for UHF signals or &#8722;49dBm for VHF signals at the input terminals of the signal processing equipment, if such station does not agree to be responsible for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Market determinations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of this section, a broadcasting station's market shall be determined by the Commission by regulation or order using, where available, commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns, except that, following a written request, the Commission may, with respect to a particular television broadcast station, include additional communities within its television market or exclude communities from such station's television market to better effectuate the purposes of this section. In considering such requests, the Commission may determine that particular communities are part of more than one television market.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In considering requests filed pursuant to clause (i), the Commission shall afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account such factors as&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) whether the station, or other stations located in the same area, have been historically carried on the cable system or systems within such community;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a cable system in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) evidence of viewing patterns in cable and noncable households within the areas served by the cable system or systems in such community.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) A cable operator shall not delete from carriage the signal of a commercial television station during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Within 120 days after the date on which a request is filed under this subparagraph (or 120 days after February 8, 1996, if later), the Commission shall grant or deny the request.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified low power station</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &#8220;qualified low power station&#8221; means any television broadcast station conforming to the rules established for Low Power Television Stations contained in part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, only if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such station meets all obligations and requirements applicable to television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to the broadcast of nonentertainment programming; programming and rates involving political candidates, election issues, controversial issues of public importance, editorials, and personal attacks; programming for children; and equal employment opportunity; and the Commission determines that the provision of such programming by such station would address local news and informational needs which are not being adequately served by full power television broadcast stations because of the geographic distance of such full power stations from the low power station's community of license;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such station complies with interference regulations consistent with its secondary status pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such station is located no more than 35 miles from the cable system's headend, and delivers to the principal headend of the cable system an over-the-air signal of good quality, as determined by the Commission;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the community of license of such station and the franchise area of the cable system are both located outside of the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, ranked by population, as determined by the Office of Management and Budget on June 30, 1990, and the population of such community of license on such date did not exceed 35,000; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;543 &#183; Regulation of rates</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Competition preference; local and Federal regulation</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">No Federal agency or State may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service except to the extent provided under this section and section 532 of this title. Any franchising authority may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service, or any other communications service provided over a cable system to cable subscribers, but only to the extent provided under this section. No Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may regulate the rates for cable service of a cable system that is owned or operated by a local government or franchising authority within whose jurisdiction that cable system is located and that is the only cable system located within such jurisdiction.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preference for competition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission finds that a cable system is subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable service by such system shall not be subject to regulation by the Commission or by a State or franchising authority under this section. If the Commission finds that a cable system is not subject to effective competition&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for the provision of basic cable service shall be subject to regulation by a franchising authority, or by the Commission if the Commission exercises jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (6), in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A franchising authority that seeks to exercise the regulatory jurisdiction permitted under paragraph (2)(A) shall file with the Commission a written certification that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority will adopt and administer regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority has the legal authority to adopt, and the personnel to administer, such regulations; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Approval by Commission</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification filed by a franchising authority under paragraph (3) shall be effective 30 days after the date on which it is filed unless the Commission finds, after notice to the authority and a reasonable opportunity for the authority to comment, that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority has adopted or is administering regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are not consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority does not have the legal authority to adopt, or the personnel to administer, such regulations; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority do not provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification, the Commission shall notify the franchising authority of any revisions or modifications necessary to obtain approval.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation of jurisdiction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon petition by a cable operator or other interested party, the Commission shall review the regulation of cable system rates by a franchising authority under this subsection. A copy of the petition shall be provided to the franchising authority by the person filing the petition. If the Commission finds that the franchising authority has acted inconsistently with the requirements of this subsection, the Commission shall grant appropriate relief. If the Commission, after the franchising authority has had a reasonable opportunity to comment, determines that the State and local laws and regulations are not in conformance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall revoke the jurisdiction of such authority.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exercise of jurisdiction by Commission</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification under paragraph (4), or revokes such authority's jurisdiction under paragraph (5), the Commission shall exercise the franchising authority's regulatory jurisdiction under paragraph (2)(A) until the franchising authority has qualified to exercise that jurisdiction by filing a new certification that meets the requirements of paragraph (3). Such new certification shall be effective upon approval by the Commission. The Commission shall act to approve or disapprove any such new certification within 90 days after the date it is filed.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Aggregation of equipment costs</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall allow cable operators, pursuant to any rules promulgated under subsection (b)(3) of this section, to aggregate, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level, their equipment costs into broad categories, such as converter boxes, regardless of the varying levels of functionality of the equipment within each such broad category. Such aggregation shall not be permitted with respect to equipment used by subscribers who receive only a rate regulated basic service tier.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revision to Commission rules; forms</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 120 days of February 8, 1996, the Commission shall issue revisions to the appropriate rules and forms necessary to implement subparagraph (A).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of basic service tier rate regulations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission obligation to subscribers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, by regulation, ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable. Such regulations shall be designed to achieve the goal of protecting subscribers of any cable system that is not subject to effective competition from rates for the basic service tier that exceed the rates that would be charged for the basic service tier if such cable system were subject to effective competition.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe, and periodically thereafter revise, regulations to carry out its obligations under paragraph (1). In prescribing such regulations, the Commission&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall seek to reduce the administrative burdens on subscribers, cable operators, franchising authorities, and the Commission;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may adopt formulas or other mechanisms and procedures in complying with the requirements of subparagraph (A); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall take into account the following factors:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the direct costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing signals carried on the basic service tier, including signals and services carried on the basic service tier pursuant to paragraph (7)(B), and changes in such costs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) only such portion of the joint and common costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing such signals as is determined, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to be reasonably and properly allocable to the basic service tier, and changes in such costs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the basic service tier or from other consideration obtained in connection with the basic service tier;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the reasonably and properly allocable portion of any amount assessed as a franchise fee, tax, or charge of any kind imposed by any State or local authority on the transactions between cable operators and cable subscribers or any other fee, tax, or assessment of general applicability imposed by a governmental entity applied against cable operators or cable subscribers;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) any amount required, in accordance with paragraph (4), to satisfy franchise requirements to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) a reasonable profit, as defined by the Commission consistent with the Commission's obligations to subscribers under paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Equipment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to establish, on the basis of actual cost, the price or rate for&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) installation and lease of the equipment used by subscribers to receive the basic service tier, including a converter box and a remote control unit and, if requested by the subscriber, such addressable converter box or other equipment as is required to access programming described in paragraph (8); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) installation and monthly use of connections for additional television receivers.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Costs of franchise requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to identify costs attributable to satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Implementation and enforcement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include additional standards, guidelines, and procedures concerning the implementation and enforcement of such regulations, which shall include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) procedures by which cable operators may implement and franchising authorities may enforce the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) procedures for the expeditious resolution of disputes between cable operators and franchising authorities concerning the administration of such regulations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) standards and procedures to prevent unreasonable charges for changes in the subscriber's selection of services or equipment subject to regulation under this section, which standards shall require that charges for changing the service tier selected shall be based on the cost of such change and shall not exceed nominal amounts when the system's configuration permits changes in service tier selection to be effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple method; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) standards and procedures to assure that subscribers receive notice of the availability of the basic service tier required under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The procedures prescribed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (5)(A) shall require a cable operator to provide 30 days&#8217; advance notice to a franchising authority of any increase proposed in the price to be charged for the basic service tier.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Components of basic tier subject to rate regulation</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Minimum contents</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each cable operator of a cable system shall provide its subscribers a separately available basic service tier to which subscription is required for access to any other tier of service. Such basic service tier shall, at a minimum, consist of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) All signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of sections 534 and 535 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Any public, educational, and governmental access programming required by the franchise of the cable system to be provided to subscribers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Any signal of any television broadcast station that is provided by the cable operator to any subscriber, except a signal which is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier beyond the local service area of such station.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Permitted additions to basic tier</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may add additional video programming signals or services to the basic service tier. Any such additional signals or services provided on the basic service tier shall be provided to subscribers at rates determined under the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Buy-through of other tiers prohibited</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Prohibition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may not require the subscription to any tier other than the basic service tier required by paragraph (7) as a condition of access to video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. A cable operator may not discriminate between subscribers to the basic service tier and other subscribers with regard to the rates charged for video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception; limitation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prohibition in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a cable system that, by reason of the lack of addressable converter boxes or other technological limitations, does not permit the operator to offer programming on a per channel or per program basis in the same manner required by subparagraph (A). This subparagraph shall not be available to any cable operator after&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the technology utilized by the cable system is modified or improved in a way that eliminates such technological limitation; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 10 years after October 5, 1992, subject to subparagraph (C).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in any proceeding initiated at the request of any cable operator, the Commission determines that compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (A) would require the cable operator to increase its rates, the Commission may, to the extent consistent with the public interest, grant such cable operator a waiver from such requirements for such specified period as the Commission determines reasonable and appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulation of unreasonable rates</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) criteria prescribed in accordance with paragraph (2) for identifying, in individual cases, rates for cable programming services that are unreasonable;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fair and expeditious procedures for the receipt, consideration, and resolution of complaints from any franchising authority (in accordance with paragraph (3)) alleging that a rate for cable programming services charged by a cable operator violates the criteria prescribed under subparagraph (A), which procedures shall include the minimum showing that shall be required for a complaint to obtain Commission consideration and resolution of whether the rate in question is unreasonable; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the procedures to be used to reduce rates for cable programming services that are determined by the Commission to be unreasonable and to refund such portion of the rates or charges that were paid by subscribers after the filing of the first complaint filed with the franchising authority under paragraph (3) and that are determined to be unreasonable.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to be considered</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the criteria for determining in individual cases whether rates for cable programming services are unreasonable under paragraph (1)(A), the Commission shall consider, among other factors&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for similarly situated cable systems offering comparable cable programming services, taking into account similarities in facilities, regulatory and governmental costs, the number of subscribers, and other relevant factors;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the history of the rates for cable programming services of the system, including the relationship of such rates to changes in general consumer prices;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the rates, as a whole, for all the cable programming, cable equipment, and cable services provided by the system, other than programming provided on a per channel or per program basis;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) capital and operating costs of the cable system, including the quality and costs of the customer service provided by the cable system; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the service for which a rate is being established, and changes in such revenues, or from other consideration obtained in connection with the cable programming services concerned.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review of rate changes</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall review any complaint submitted by a franchising authority after February 8, 1996, concerning an increase in rates for cable programming services and issue a final order within 90 days after it receives such a complaint, unless the parties agree to extend the period for such review. A franchising authority may not file a complaint under this paragraph unless, within 90 days after such increase becomes effective it receives subscriber complaints.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sunset of upper tier rate regulation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to cable programming services provided after March 31, 1999.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Uniform rate structure required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall have a rate structure, for the provision of cable service, that is uniform throughout the geographic area in which cable service is provided over its cable system. This subsection does not apply to (1) a cable operator with respect to the provision of cable service over its cable system in any geographic area in which the video programming services offered by the operator in that area are subject to effective competition, or (2) any video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. Bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units shall not be subject to this subsection, except that a cable operator of a cable system that is not subject to effective competition may not charge predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit. Upon a prima facie showing by a complainant that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discounted price is predatory, the cable system shall have the burden of showing that its discounted price is not predatory.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Discrimination; services for the hearing impaired</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting any Federal agency, State, or a franchising authority from&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prohibiting discrimination among subscribers and potential subscribers to cable service, except that no Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may prohibit a cable operator from offering reasonable discounts to senior citizens or other economically disadvantaged group discounts; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring and regulating the installation or rental of equipment which facilitates the reception of cable service by hearing impaired individuals.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Negative option billing prohibited</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection of information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, by regulation, require cable operators to file with the Commission or a franchising authority, as appropriate, within one year after October 5, 1992, and annually thereafter, such financial information as may be needed for purposes of administering and enforcing this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prevention of evasions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish standards, guidelines, and procedures to prevent evasions, including evasions that result from retiering, of the requirements of this section and shall, thereafter, periodically review and revise such standards, guidelines, and procedures.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Small system burdens</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In developing and prescribing regulations pursuant to this section, the Commission shall design such regulations to reduce the administrative burdens and cost of compliance for cable systems that have 1,000 or fewer subscribers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Rate regulation agreements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">During the term of an agreement made before July 1, 1990, by a franchising authority and a cable operator providing for the regulation of basic cable service rates, where there was not effective competition under Commission rules in effect on that date, nothing in this section (or the regulations thereunder) shall abridge the ability of such franchising authority to regulate rates in accordance with such an agreement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports on average prices</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall annually publish statistical reports on the average rates for basic cable service and other cable programming, and for converter boxes, remote control units, and other equipment, of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cable systems that the Commission has found are subject to effective competition under subsection (a)(2) of this section, compared with</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cable systems that the Commission has found are not subject to such effective competition.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(l) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &#8220;effective competition&#8221; means that&#8212;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;544a &#183; Consumer electronics equipment compatibility</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) new and recent models of television receivers and video cassette recorders often contain premium features and functions that are disabled or inhibited because of cable scrambling, encoding, or encryption technologies and devices, including converter boxes and remote control devices required by cable operators to receive programming;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if these problems are allowed to persist, consumers will be less likely to purchase, and electronics equipment manufacturers will be less likely to develop, manufacture, or offer for sale, television receivers and video cassette recorders with new and innovative features and functions;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) cable operators should use technologies that will prevent signal thefts while permitting consumers to benefit from such features and functions in such receivers and recorders; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) compatibility among televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems can be assured with narrow technical standards that mandate a minimum degree of common design and operation, leaving all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options for selection through open competition in the market.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compatible interfaces</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report; regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 1 year after October 5, 1992, the Commission, in consultation with representatives of the cable industry and the consumer electronics industry, shall report to Congress on means of assuring compatibility between televisions and video cassette recorders and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable systems and the functions available on their televisions and video cassette recorders. Within 180 days after the date of submission of the report required by this subsection, the Commission shall issue such regulations as are necessary to assure such compatibility.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scrambling and encryption</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing the regulations referred to in paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether and, if so, under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict cable systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals, except that the Commission shall not limit the use of scrambling or encryption technology where the use of such technology does not interfere with the functions of subscribers&#8217; television receivers or video cassette recorders.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rulemaking requirements</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Factors to be considered</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing the regulations required by this section, the Commission shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need to maximize open competition in the market for all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options of converter boxes and other cable converters unrelated to the descrambling or decryption of cable television signals;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the costs and benefits to consumers of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators and television manufacturers in a manner that, while providing effective protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable service, will minimize interference with or nullification of the special functions of subscribers&#8217; television receivers or video cassette recorders, including functions that permit the subscriber&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or to protect such signals against unauthorized reception.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section shall include such regulations as are necessary&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to specify the technical requirements with which a television receiver or video cassette recorder must comply in order to be sold as &#8220;cable compatible&#8221; or &#8220;cable ready&#8221;;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to require cable operators offering channels whose reception requires a converter box&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may be unable to benefit from the special functions of their television receivers and video cassette recorders, including functions that permit subscribers&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent technically and economically feasible, to offer subscribers the option of having all other channels delivered directly to the subscribers&#8217; television receivers or video cassette recorders without passing through the converter box;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote the commercial availability, from cable operators and retail vendors that are not affiliated with cable systems, of converter boxes and of remote control devices compatible with converter boxes;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to ensure that any standards or regulations developed under the authority of this section to ensure compatibility between televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems do not affect features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options other than those specified in paragraph (1)(B), including telecommunications interface equipment, home automation communications, and computer network services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to require a cable operator who offers subscribers the option of renting a remote control unit&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may purchase a commercially available remote control device from any source that sells such devices rather than renting it from the cable operator; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to specify the types of remote control units that are compatible with the converter box supplied by the cable operator; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to prohibit a cable operator from taking any action that prevents or in any way disables the converter box supplied by the cable operator from operating compatibly with commercially available remote control units.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall periodically review and, if necessary, modify the regulations issued pursuant to this section in light of any actions taken in response to such regulations and to reflect improvements and changes in cable systems, television receivers, video cassette recorders, and similar technology.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, periodically but not less frequently than every five years, investigate the employment practices of each entity described in subsection (a) of this section, in the aggregate, as well as in individual job categories, and determine whether such entity is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, including whether such entity's employment practices deny or abridge women and minorities equal employment opportunities.

Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the forfeiture imposed on any person as a result of any violation that continues subsequent to such notification. In addition, any person liable for such penalty may also have any license under this chapter for cable auxiliary relay service suspended until the Commission determines that the failure involved has been corrected. Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or submits documentation which he knows to be false, pursuant to an application for certification under this section shall be in violation of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4), and the last 2 sentences of paragraph (2), of section 503(b) of this title shall apply to forfeitures under this subsection.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;761 &#183; Federal Communications Commission licensing</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Licensing for separated entities</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Competition test</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may not issue a license or construction permit to any separated entity, or renew or permit the assignment or use of any such license or permit, or authorize the use by any entity subject to United States jurisdiction of any space segment owned, leased, or operated by any separated entity, unless the Commission determines that such issuance, renewal, assignment, or use will not harm competition in the telecommunications market of the United States. If the Commission does not make such a determination, it shall deny or revoke authority to use space segment owned, leased, or operated by the separated entity to provide services to, from, or within the United States.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Criteria for competition test</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763 and 763b&#160;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Licensing for INTELSAT, Inmarsat, and successor entities</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Competition test</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In considering the application of INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities for a license or construction permit, or for the renewal or assignment or use of any such license or permit, or in considering the request of any entity subject to United States jurisdiction for authorization to use any space segment owned, leased, or operated by INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities, to provide non-core services to, from, or within the United States, the Commission shall determine whether&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after April 1, 2001, in the case of INTELSAT and its successor entities, INTELSAT and any successor entities have been privatized in a manner that will harm competition in the telecommunications markets of the United States; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after April 1, 2000, in the case of Inmarsat and its successor entities, Inmarsat and any successor entities have been privatized in a manner that will harm competition in the telecommunications markets of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consequences of determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission determines that such competition will be harmed or that grant of such application or request for authority is not otherwise in the public interest, the Commission shall limit through conditions or deny such application or request, and limit or revoke previous authorizations to provide non-core services to, from, or within the United States. After due notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall apply the same limitations, restrictions, and conditions to all entities subject to United States jurisdiction using space segment owned, leased, or operated by INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) National security, law enforcement, and public safety</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall not impose any limitation, condition, or restriction under subparagraph (B) in a manner that will, or is reasonably likely to, result in limitation, denial, or revocation of authority for non-core services that are used by and required for a national security agency or law enforcement department or agency of the United States, or used by and required for, and otherwise in the public interest, any other Department or Agency of the United States to protect the health and safety of the public. Such services may be obtained by the United States directly from INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or a successor entity, or indirectly through COMSAT, or authorized carriers or distributors of the successor entity.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Rule of construction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude the Commission from acting upon applications of INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities prior to the latest date set out in section 763(5)(A) of this title, including such actions as may be necessary for the United States to become the licensing jurisdiction for INTELSAT, but the Commission shall condition a grant of authority pursuant to this subsection upon compliance with sections 763 and 763a of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Criteria for competition test</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763, 763a, and 763c&#160;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Clarification: competitive safeguards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making its licensing decisions under this subsection, the Commission shall consider whether users of non-core services provided by INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated entities are able to obtain non-core services from providers offering services other than through INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated entities, at competitive rates, terms, or conditions. Such consideration shall also include whether such licensing decisions would require users to replace equipment at substantial costs prior to the termination of its design life. In making its licensing decisions, the Commission shall also consider whether competitive alternatives in individual markets do not exist because they have been foreclosed due to anticompetitive actions undertaken by or resulting from the INTELSAT or Inmarsat systems. Such licensing decisions shall be made in a manner which facilitates achieving the purposes and goals in this subchapter and shall be subject to notice and comment.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional considerations in determinations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In making its determinations and licensing decisions under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Commission shall construe such subsections in a manner consistent with the United States obligations and commitments for satellite services under the Fourth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Independent facilities competition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed as precluding COMSAT from investing in or owning satellites or other facilities independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or separated entities, or from providing services through reselling capacity over the facilities of satellite systems independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or separated entities. This subsection shall not be construed as restricting the types of contracts which can be executed or services which may be provided by COMSAT over the independent satellites or facilities described in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is provided by any entity engaged in the business of commercial lending&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the loan is provided by a lender described in clause (i)(II) and the Board determines that the making of the loan by such lender will cause a decline in such lender's debt rating as described in that clause, the Board at its discretion may disapprove the loan guarantee on this basis;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) no loan may be made for purposes of this chapter by a governmental entity or affiliate thereof, or by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or any institution supervised by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the Federal Housing Finance Board, or any affiliate of such entities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) any loan must have terms, in the judgment of the Board, that are consistent in material respects with the terms of similar obligations in the private capital market;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) for purposes of clause (i)(I)(bb), the term &#8220;net equity&#8221; means the value of the total assets of the entity, less the total liabilities of the entity, as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles for the fiscal quarter ended immediately prior to the date on which the subject loan is approved;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) repayment of the loan is required to be made within a term of the lesser of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the terms, conditions, security, and schedule and amount of repayments of principal and the payment of interest with respect to the loan protect the financial interests of the United States and are reasonable;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Considerations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Type of market</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Priority considerations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent practicable, the Board shall give priority in the approval of loan guarantees under this chapter in the following order:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) First, to projects that will serve households in nonserved areas. In considering such projects, the Board shall balance projects that will serve the largest number of households with projects that will serve remote, isolated communities (including noncontiguous States) in areas that are unlikely to be served through market mechanisms.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Second, to projects that will serve households in underserved areas. In considering such projects, the Board shall balance projects that will serve the largest number of households with projects that will serve remote, isolated communities (including noncontiguous States) in areas that are unlikely to be served through market mechanisms.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Within each category, the Board shall consider the project's estimated cost per household and shall give priority to those projects that provide the highest quality service at the lowest cost per household.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional consideration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board should give additional consideration to projects that also provide high-speed Internet service.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prohibitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may not approve a loan guarantee under this chapter for a project that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is designed primarily to serve 1 or more of the top 40 designated market areas (as that term is defined in section 122(j) of title 17); or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would alter or remove National Weather Service warnings from local broadcast signals.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other considerations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall consider other factors, which shall include projects that would&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer a separate tier of local broadcast signals, but for applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide lower projected costs to consumers of such separate tier; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) enable the delivery of local broadcast signals consistent with the purpose of this chapter by a means reasonably compatible with existing systems or devices predominantly in use.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Further consideration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In implementing this chapter, the Board shall support the use of loan guarantees for projects that would serve households not likely to be served in the absence of loan guarantees under this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Guarantee limits</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation on aggregate value of loans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The aggregate value of all loans for which loan guarantees are issued under this chapter (including the unguaranteed portion of such loans) may not exceed $1,250,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan guarantee issued under this chapter may not exceed an amount equal to 80 percent of a loan meeting in its entirety the requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section. If only a portion of a loan meets the requirements of that subsection, the Board shall determine that percentage of the loan meeting such requirements (the &#8220;applicable portion&#8221;) and may issue a loan guarantee in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the applicable portion.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Underwriting criteria</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Within the period provided for under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Board shall, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and an independent public accounting firm, develop underwriting criteria relating to the guarantee of loans that are consistent with the purpose of this chapter, including appropriate collateral and cash flow levels for loans guaranteed under this chapter, and such other matters as the Board considers appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that appropriations of budget authority are sufficient to cover the cost, as determined under section 661a(5) of title 2, of loan guarantees under this chapter, the credit risk premium with respect to each loan guarantee shall be reduced proportionately.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Payment of premiums</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be paid to an account (the &#8220;Escrow Account&#8221;) established in the Treasury which shall accrue interest and such interest shall be retained by the account, subject to subparagraph (D).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Deductions from Escrow Account</h4>
