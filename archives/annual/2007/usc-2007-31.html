<p class="statutory-body">(a) After trying to collect a claim from a person under section 3711(a) of this title, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may collect the claim by administrative offset. The head of the agency may collect by administrative offset only after giving the debtor&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention of the head of the agency to collect the claim by administrative offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor under this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) adopt, without change, regulations on collecting by administrative offset promulgated by the Department of Justice, the Government Accountability Office, or the Department of the Treasury; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribe regulations on collecting by administrative offset consistent with the regulations referred to in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a disbursing official of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, or any other government corporation, or any disbursing official of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall offset at least annually the amount of a payment which a payment certifying agency has certified to the disbursing official for disbursement, by an amount equal to the amount of a claim which a creditor agency has certified to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agency that designates disbursing officials pursuant to section 3321(c) of this title is not required to certify claims arising out of its operations to the Secretary of the Treasury before such agency's disbursing officials offset such claims.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Payments certified by the Department of Education under a program administered by the Secretary of Education under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not be subject to administrative offset under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Neither the disbursing official nor the payment certifying agency shall be liable&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the amount of the administrative offset on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the administrative offset was taken, was not satisfied; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including sections 207 and 1631(d)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 407 and 1383(d)(1)), section 413(b) of Public Law 91&#8211;173 (30 U.S.C. 923(b)), and section 14 of the Act of August 29, 1935 (45 U.S.C. 231m)), except as provided in clause (ii), all payments due to an individual under&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Social Security Act,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board determines to be tier 2 benefits),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be subject to offset under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) An amount of $9,000 which a debtor may receive under Federal benefit programs cited under clause (i) within a 12-month period shall be exempt from offset under this subsection. In applying the $9,000 exemption, the disbursing official shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) reduce the $9,000 exemption amount for the 12-month period by the amount of all Federal benefit payments made during such 12-month period which are not subject to offset under this subsection; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) apply a prorated amount of the exemption to each periodic benefit payment to be made to the debtor during the applicable 12-month period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of a periodic benefit payment shall be the amount after any reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the program under which such payment is authorized to be made (including any reduction or deduction to recover any overpayment under such program).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt from administrative offset under this subsection payments under means-tested programs when requested by the head of the respective agency. The Secretary may exempt other payments from administrative offset under this subsection upon the written request of the head of a payment certifying agency. A written request for exemption of other payments must provide justification for the exemption under standards prescribed by the Secretary. Such standards shall give due consideration to whether administrative offset would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment certifying agency's program. The Secretary shall report to the Congress annually on exemptions granted under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The provisions of sections 205(b)(1), 809(a)(1), and 1631(c)(1) of the Social Security Act shall not apply to any administrative offset executed pursuant to this section against benefits authorized by title II, VIII, or title XVI of the Social Security Act, respectively.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing this subsection. The fee may be collected either by the retention of a portion of amounts collected pursuant to this subsection, or by billing the agency referring or transferring a claim for those amounts. Fees charged to the agencies shall be based on actual administrative offsets completed. Amounts received by the United States as fees under this subsection shall be deposited into the account of the Department of the Treasury under section 3711(g)(7) of this title, and shall be collected and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary of the Treasury considers necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary shall consult with the heads of affected agencies in the development of such rules, regulations, and procedures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any Federal agency that is owed by a person a past due, legally enforceable nontax debt that is over 180 days delinquent, including nontax debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government, shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes of administrative offset under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The disbursing official conducting an administrative offset with respect to a payment to a payee shall notify the payee in writing of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the occurrence of the administrative offset to satisfy a past due legally enforceable debt, including a description of the type and amount of the payment otherwise payable to the payee against which the offset was executed;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the payment to be offset is a periodic benefit payment, the disbursing official shall take reasonable steps, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide the notice to the payee not later than the date on which the payee is otherwise scheduled to receive the payment, or as soon as practical thereafter, but no later than the date of the administrative offset. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the failure of the debtor to receive such notice shall not impair the legality of such administrative offset.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over requests for administrative offset pursuant to other laws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the use of any other administrative offset authority existing under statute or common law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not apply&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to a claim under this subchapter that has been outstanding for more than 10 years; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when a statute explicitly prohibits using administrative offset or setoff to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of sections 552a(o) and (p) of title 5 for administrative offset or claims collection upon written certification by the head of a State or an executive, judicial, or legislative agency seeking to collect the claim that the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have been met.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury established under 552a(u) of title 5 shall review and include in reports under paragraph (3)(D) of that section a description of any matching activities conducted under this section. If the Secretary has granted a waiver under subsection (f) of this section, no other Data Integrity Board is required to take any action under section 552a(u) of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, apply subsection (a) with respect to any past-due, legally-enforceable debt owed to a State if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the appropriate State disbursing official requests that an offset be performed; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a reciprocal agreement with the State is in effect which contains, at a minimum&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) requirements substantially equivalent to subsection (b) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any other requirements which the Secretary considers appropriate to facilitate the offset and prevent duplicative efforts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not apply to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the collection of a debt or claim on which the administrative costs associated with the collection of the debt or claim exceed the amount of the debt or claim;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any collection of any other type, class, or amount of claim, as the Secretary considers necessary to protect the interest of the United States; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the disbursement of any class or type of payment exempted by the Secretary of the Treasury at the request of a Federal agency.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;3730 &#183; Civil actions for false claims</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Responsibilities of the Attorney General.&#8212;The Attorney General diligently shall investigate a violation under section 3729. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a civil action under this section against the person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Actions by Private Persons.&#8212;(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Rights of the Parties to Qui Tam Actions.&#8212;(1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person has been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Award to Qui Tam Plaintiff.&#8212;(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action, represented by the Department of Justice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Certain Actions Barred.&#8212;(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service in the armed forces.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subsection (b) against a Member of Congress, a member of the judiciary, or a senior executive branch official if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Government when the action was brought.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &#8220;senior executive branch official&#8221; means any officer or employee listed in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 101(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In no event may a person bring an action under subsection (b) which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Government is already a party.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &#8220;original source&#8221; means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Government Not Liable for Certain Expenses.&#8212;The Government is not liable for expenses which a person incurs in bringing an action under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Fees and Expenses to Prevailing Defendant.&#8212;In civil actions brought under this section by the United States, the provisions of section 2412(d) of title 28 shall apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees. An employee may bring an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Issuance and service.&#8212;Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to a false claims law investigation, the Attorney General may, before commencing a civil proceeding under section 3730 or other false claims law, issue in writing and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person&#8212;</p>

The testimony shall be taken stenographically and shall be transcribed. When the testimony is fully transcribed, the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall promptly transmit a copy of the transcript of the testimony to the custodian. This subsection shall not preclude the taking of testimony by any means authorized by, and in a manner consistent with, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

The transcript shall then be signed by the witness, unless the witness in writing waives the signing, is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign.

An objection may be made, received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on the grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including the privilege against self-incrimination. Such person may not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any question, and may not directly or through counsel otherwise interrupt the oral examination. If such person refuses to answer any question, a petition may be filed in the district court of the United States under subsection (j)(1) for an order compelling such person to answer such question.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;3902 &#183; Interest penalties</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed under section 3903 of this title, the head of an agency acquiring property or service from a business concern, who does not pay the concern for each complete delivered item of property or service by the required payment date, shall pay an interest penalty to the concern on the amount of the payment due. The interest shall be computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest payments under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611), which is in effect at the time the agency accrues the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The interest penalty shall be paid for the period beginning on the day after the required payment date and ending on the date on which payment is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A business concern shall be entitled to an interest penalty of $1.00 or more which is owed such business concern under this section, and such penalty shall be paid without regard to whether the business concern has requested payment of such penalty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each payment subject to this chapter for which a late payment interest penalty is required to be paid shall be accompanied by a notice stating the amount of the interest penalty included in such payment and the rate by which, and period for which, such penalty was computed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a business concern&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is owed an interest penalty by an agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">such business concern shall be entitled to an amount equal to the sum of the late payment interest penalty to which the contractor is entitled and an additional penalty equal to a percentage of such late payment interest penalty specified by regulation by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, subject to such maximum as may be specified in such regulations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely payment due for property or services does not relieve the head of an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) An amount of an interest penalty unpaid after any 30-day period shall be added to the principal amount of the debt, and a penalty accrues thereafter on the added amount.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not authorize the appropriation of additional amounts to pay an interest penalty. The head of an agency shall pay a penalty under this section out of amounts made available to carry out the program for which the penalty is incurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) A recipient of a grant from the head of an agency may provide in a contract for the acquisition of property or service from a business concern that, consistent with the usual business practices of the recipient and applicable State and local law, the recipient will pay an interest penalty on amounts overdue under the contract under conditions agreed to by the recipient and the concern. The recipient may not pay the penalty from amounts received from an agency. Amounts expended for the penalty may not be counted toward a matching requirement applicable to the grant. An obligation to pay the penalty is not an obligation of the United States Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) This section shall apply to contracts for the procurement of property or services entered into pursuant to section 4(h) of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714b(h)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a payment to which producers on a farm are entitled under the terms of an agreement entered into under the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.), an interest penalty shall be paid to the producers if the payment has not been made by the required payment or loan closing date. The interest penalty shall be paid&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the amount of payment or loan due; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for the period beginning on the first day beginning after the required payment or loan closing date and ending on the date the amount is paid or loaned.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) As used in this subsection, the &#8220;required payment or loan closing date&#8221; means&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a purchase agreement, the 30th day after delivery of the warehouse receipt for the commodity subject to the purchase agreement;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a loan agreement, the 30th day beginning after the date of receipt of an application with all requisite documentation and signatures, unless the applicant requests that the disbursement be deferred;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) for land diversion payments (other than advance payments), the 30th day beginning after the date of completion of the production adjustment contract by the producer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) for an advance land diversion payment, 30 days after the date the Commodity Credit Corporation executes the contract with the producer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payment of the interest penalty under this subsection shall be made out of funds available under section 8 of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714f).</p>

However, to prevent or alleviate a shortage of a denomination, the Secretary may inscribe coins of the denomination with the year that was last inscribed on coins of the denomination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall prepare the devices, models, hubs, and dies for coins, emblems, devices, inscriptions, and designs authorized under this chapter.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;5342 &#183; High-risk money laundering and related financial crime areas</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Findings and Purpose.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Findings.&#8212;The Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Money laundering and related financial crimes frequently appear to be concentrated in particular geographic areas, financial systems, industry sectors, or financial institutions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) While the Secretary has the responsibility to act with regard to Federal offenses which are being committed in a particular locality or are directed at a single institution, because modern financial systems and institutions are interconnected to a degree which was not possible until recently, money laundering and other related financial crimes are likely to have local, State, national, and international effects wherever they are committed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Purpose and objective.&#8212;It is the purpose of this section to provide a mechanism for designating any area where money laundering or a related financial crime appears to be occurring at a higher than average rate such that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a comprehensive approach to the problem of such crime in such area can be developed, in cooperation with State and local law enforcement agencies, which utilizes the authority of the Secretary to prevent such activity; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such area can be targeted for law enforcement action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Element of National Strategy.&#8212;The designation of certain areas as areas in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk shall be an element of the national strategy developed pursuant to section 5341(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Case-by-case determination in consultation with the attorney general.&#8212;In addition to the factors specified in subsection (d), any designation of any area under paragraph (1) shall be made on the basis of a determination by the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, that the particular area, industry, sector, or institution is being victimized by, or is particularly vulnerable to, money laundering and related financial crimes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Specific initiatives.&#8212;Any head of a department, bureau, or law enforcement agency, including any State or local prosecutor, involved in the detection, prevention, and suppression of money laundering and related financial crimes and any State or local official or prosecutor may submit&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written request for funding under section 5351 for a specific prevention or enforcement initiative, or to determine the extent of financial criminal activity, in an area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Factors.&#8212;In considering the designation of any area as a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area, the Secretary shall, to the extent appropriate and in consultation with the Attorney General, take into account the following factors:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Whether the area is an international center for banking or commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The extent to which financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area are having a harmful impact in other areas of the country.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The number or nature of requests for information or analytical assistance which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are made to the analytical component of the Department of the Treasury; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) originate from law enforcement or regulatory authorities located in such area or involve institutions or businesses located in such area or residents of such area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Unusual patterns, anomalies, or changes in the volume or nature of transactions conducted through financial institutions operating within or outside the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The extent to which a significant increase in the allocation of Federal resources to combat financial crimes in such area is necessary to provide an adequate State and local response to financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area.</p>

<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter IV&#8212;Prohibition on Funding of Unlawful Internet Gambling</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;5361 &#183; Congressional findings and purpose</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Findings.&#8212;Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Internet gambling is primarily funded through personal use of payment system instruments, credit cards, and wire transfers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1999 recommended the passage of legislation to prohibit wire transfers to Internet gambling sites or the banks which represent such sites.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Internet gambling is a growing cause of debt collection problems for insured depository institutions and the consumer credit industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) New mechanisms for enforcing gambling laws on the Internet are necessary because traditional law enforcement mechanisms are often inadequate for enforcing gambling prohibitions or regulations on the Internet, especially where such gambling crosses State or national borders.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Rule of Construction.&#8212;No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as altering, limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the United States.</p>

Such regulations shall apply to a State until such time as the Secretary enters into an agreement with the State under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary shall issue regulations that shall require a State, when not inconsistent with program purposes, to pay interest to the United States on funds from the time funds are deposited by the United States to the State's account until the time that funds are paid out by the State in order to redeem checks or warrants or make payments by other means for program purposes. Except as provided under paragraph (3)(B) (relating to the Unemployment Trust Fund), the interest payable under this subsection shall be calculated at a rate equal to the average of the bond equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the period for which interest is calculated, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

Such interest shall be calculated, at a rate equal to the average of the bond equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the period for which interest is calculated, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If interest is paid under this subsection as a result of a State disbursing its own funds before receiving payment from a trust fund for which the Secretary of the Treasury is the trustee, such interest shall be charged against such trust fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The economic and social development of the United States and the achievement of satisfactory levels of living depend on the sound and orderly development of urban and rural areas.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In addition to payments the Secretary of the Interior makes under section 6902 of this title, the Secretary shall make a payment for each fiscal year to a unit of general local government collecting and distributing real property taxes (including a unit in Alaska outside the boundaries of an organized borough) in which is located an interest in land that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) was subject to local real property taxes within the 5-year period before the interest is acquired.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall make payments only for the 5 fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the interest in land is acquired. Under guidelines the Secretary prescribes, the unit of general local government receiving the payment from the Secretary shall distribute payments proportionally to units and school districts that lost real property taxes because of the acquisition of the interest. A unit receiving a distribution may use a payment for any governmental purpose.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each yearly payment by the Secretary under this section is equal to one percent of the fair market value of the interest in land on the date the Government acquires the interest. However, a payment may not be more than the amount of real property taxes levied on the property during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest is acquired. A decision on fair market value under this section may not include an increase in the value of an interest because the land is rezoned when the rezoning causes the increase after the date of enactment of a law authorizing the acquisition of an interest under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments may be made to units of general local government when subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not carry out the purpose of subsections (a) and (b).</p>

A unit may use the payment for any governmental purpose. The payment shall be made as provided in section 6903 of this title and shall include an amount payable under section 6903.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In addition to payments the Secretary makes under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall make a payment for each fiscal year to each unit of general local government in which is located an interest in land&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The payment shall be made as provided in section 6904 of this title and shall include an amount payable under section 6904. However, an amount computed but not paid because of the first sentence of subsection (b) and the 2d sentence of subsection (c) of section 6904 shall be carried forward and applied to future years in which the payment would not otherwise equal the amount of real property taxes assessed and levied on the land during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest was acquired until the amount is applied completely.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a State may enact legislation which requires that any payments which would be made to units of general local government pursuant to this chapter be reallocated and redistributed in whole or part to other smaller units of general purpose government which (1) are located within the boundaries of the larger unit of general local government, (2) provide general governmental services and (3) contain entitlement lands within their boundaries. Such reallocation or redistribution shall generally reflect the level of services provided by, and the number of entitlement acres within, the smaller unit of general local government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Upon enactment of legislation by a State, described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall make one payment to such State equaling the aggregate amount of payments which he otherwise would have made to units of general local government within such State pursuant to this chapter. It shall be the responsibility of such State to make any further distribution of the payment pursuant to subsection (a). Such redistribution shall be made within 30 days after receipt of such payment. No payment, or portion thereof, made by the Secretary shall be used by any State for the administration of this subsection or subsection (a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Appropriations made for payments in lieu of taxes for a fiscal year may be used to correct underpayments in the previous fiscal year to achieve equity among all qualified recipients.</p>
