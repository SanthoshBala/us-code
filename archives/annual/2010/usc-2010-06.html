The substantive law for decision in any such action shall be derived from the law, including choice of law principles, of the State in which such acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal cause of action shall be brought only for claims for injuries that are proximately caused by sellers that provide qualified anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal government customers.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;466 &#183; Sense of Congress reaffirming the continued importance and applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly known as the &#8220;Posse Comitatus Act&#8221;) prohibits the use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in enforcing Federal law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title 10 (commonly known as the &#8220;Insurrection Act&#8221;), and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress reaffirms the continued importance of section 1385 of title 18, and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this chapter should be construed to alter the applicability of such section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws.</p>

<h3 class="part-head">Part I&#8212;Information Sharing</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;481 &#183; Short title; findings; and sense of Congress</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">This part may be cited as the &#8220;Homeland Security Information Sharing Act&#8221;.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist attack.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal Government relies on State and local personnel to protect against terrorist attack.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and protects classified and sensitive but unclassified information to enhance homeland security.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Some homeland security information is needed by the State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for terrorist attack.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected status of such information and to protect the sources and methods used to acquire such information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and local levels of government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt classified information so it may be shared with State and local personnel without the need for granting additional security clearances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) State and local personnel have capabilities and opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Federal Government and State and local governments and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Federal, State, and local governments and intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Information systems, including the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified information among Federal, State, and local entities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Increased efforts to share homeland security information should avoid duplicating existing information systems.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sense of Congress</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland security information to the maximum extent practicable, with special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural communities.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 107&#8211;296, title VIII, &#167;891, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2252.</p>
