Upon commencing any such investigation, the Commission shall publish notice thereof in the Federal Register. The Commission shall conclude any such investigation and make its determination under this section at the earliest practicable time after the date of publication of notice of such investigation.

If the Commission has reason to believe that the matter before it (A) is based solely on alleged acts and effects which are within the purview of section 1671 or 1673 of this title, or (B) relates to an alleged copyright infringement with respect to which action is prohibited by section 1008 of title 17, the Commission shall terminate, or not institute, any investigation into the matter. If the Commission has reason to believe the matter before it is based in part on alleged acts and effects which are within the purview of section 1671 or 1673 of this title, and in part on alleged acts and effects which may, independently from or in conjunction with those within the purview of such section, establish a basis for relief under this section, then it may institute or continue an investigation into the matter. If the Commission notifies the Secretary or the administering authority (as defined in section 1677(1) of this title) with respect to a matter under this paragraph, the Commission may suspend its investigation during the time the matter is before the Secretary or administering authority for final decision.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determinations; review</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall determine, with respect to each investigation conducted by it under this section, whether or not there is a violation of this section, except that the Commission may, by issuing a consent order or on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to the investigation, including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration, terminate any such investigation, in whole or in part, without making such a determination. Each determination under subsection (d) or (e) of this section shall be made on the record after notice and opportunity for a hearing in conformity with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. All legal and equitable defenses may be presented in all cases. A respondent may raise any counterclaim in a manner prescribed by the Commission.

Any counterclaim raised pursuant to this section shall relate back to the date of the original complaint in the proceeding before the Commission. Action on such counterclaim shall not delay or affect the proceeding under this section, including the legal and equitable defenses that may be raised under this subsection. Any person adversely affected by a final determination of the Commission under subsection (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section may appeal such determination, within 60 days after the determination becomes final, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for review in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5.

Determinations by the Commission under subsections (e), (f), and (j) of this section with respect to forfeiture of bonds and under subsection (h) of this section with respect to the imposition of sanctions for abuse of discovery or abuse of process shall also be reviewable in accordance with section 706 of title 5.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusion of articles from entry</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines, as a result of an investigation under this section, that there is a violation of this section, it shall direct that the articles concerned, imported by any person violating the provision of this section, be excluded from entry into the United States, unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers, refuse such entry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the Commission to order an exclusion from entry of articles shall be limited to persons determined by the Commission to be violating this section unless the Commission determines that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a general exclusion from entry of articles is necessary to prevent circumvention of an exclusion order limited to products of named persons; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is a pattern of violation of this section and it is difficult to identify the source of infringing products.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion of articles from entry during investigation except under bond; procedures applicable; preliminary relief</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, during the course of an investigation under this section, the Commission determines that there is reason to believe that there is a violation of this section, it may direct that the articles concerned, imported by any person with respect to whom there is reason to believe that such person is violating this section, be excluded from entry into the United States, unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers, refuse such entry, except that such articles shall be entitled to entry under bond prescribed by the Secretary in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the complainant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A complainant may petition the Commission for the issuance of an order under this subsection. The Commission shall make a determination with regard to such petition by no later than the 90th day after the date on which the Commission's notice of investigation is published in the Federal Register. The Commission may extend the 90-day period for an additional 60 days in a case it designates as a more complicated case. The Commission shall publish in the Federal Register its reasons why it designated the case as being more complicated. The Commission may require the complainant to post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of an order under this subsection. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has not violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the respondent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may grant preliminary relief under this subsection or subsection (f) of this section to the same extent as preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders may be granted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall prescribe the terms and conditions under which bonds may be forfeited under paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Cease and desist orders; civil penalty for violation of orders</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to, or in lieu of, taking action under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the Commission may issue and cause to be served on any person violating this section, or believed to be violating this section, as the case may be, an order directing such person to cease and desist from engaging in the unfair methods or acts involved, unless after considering the effect of such order upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such order should not be issued. The Commission may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it deems proper, modify or revoke any such order, and, in the case of a revocation, may take action under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as the case may be. If a temporary cease and desist order is issued in addition to, or in lieu of, an exclusion order under subsection (e) of this section, the Commission may require the complainant to post a bond, in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the respondent from any injury, as a prerequisite to the issuance of an order under this subsection. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has not violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the respondent. The Commission shall prescribe the terms and conditions under which the bonds may be forfeited under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who violates an order issued by the Commission under paragraph (1) after it has become final shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty for each day on which an importation of articles, or their sale, occurs in violation of the order of not more than the greater of $100,000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold on such day in violation of the order. Such penalty shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered for the United States in a civil action brought by the Commission in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation occurs. In such actions, the United States district courts may issue mandatory injunctions incorporating the relief sought by the Commission as they deem appropriate in the enforcement of such final orders of the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the authority of the Commission to issue a general exclusion from entry of articles when a respondent appears to contest an investigation concerning a violation of the provisions of this section, a general exclusion from entry of articles, regardless of the source or importer of the articles, may be issued if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) no person appears to contest an investigation concerning a violation of the provisions of this section,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such a violation is established by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within the 5-day period (excluding weekends and holidays) following the date on which merchandise is presented for customs examination, the Customs Service shall decide whether to release or detain the merchandise.

The results and test description shall be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Seizure and forfeiture</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of failure to make determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The failure by the Customs Service to make a final determination with respect to the admissibility of detained merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been presented for customs examination, or such longer period if specifically authorized by law, shall be treated as a decision of the Customs Service to exclude the merchandise for purposes of section 1514(a)(4) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, a protest against the decision to exclude the merchandise which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was filed shall be treated as having been denied on such 30th day.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding section 2639 of title 28, once an action respecting a detention is commenced, unless the Customs Service establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for good cause, the court shall grant the appropriate relief which may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the detention and release the merchandise.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initiation by administering authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A countervailing duty investigation shall be initiated whenever the administering authority determines, from information available to it, that a formal investigation is warranted into the question of whether the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1671(a) of this title exist.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation by petition</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petition requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A countervailing duty proceeding shall be initiated whenever an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title files a petition with the administering authority, on behalf of an industry, which alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of the duty imposed by section 1671(a) of this title, and which is accompanied by information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting those allegations. The petition may be amended at such time, and upon such conditions, as the administering authority and the Commission may permit.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Simultaneous filing with Commission</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petitioner shall file a copy of the petition with the Commission on the same day as it is filed with the administering authority.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Petition based upon a derogation of an international undertaking on official export credits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sole basis of a petition filed under paragraph (1) is the derogation of an international undertaking on official export credits, the Administering Authority shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Treasury who shall, in consultation with the Administering Authority, within 5 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under subsection (c) of this section, determine the existence and estimated value of the derogation, if any, and shall publish such determination in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action with respect to petitions</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notification of governments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Nondisclosure of certain information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after examining, on the basis of sources readily available to the administering authority, the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the petition, determine whether the petition alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1671(a) of this title and contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine if the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extension of time</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the administering authority is required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the industry under paragraph (4)(D), the administering authority may, in exceptional circumstances, apply subparagraph (A) by substituting "a maximum of 40 days" for "20 days".</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Time limits where petition involves same merchandise as an order that has been revoked</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a petition is filed under this section with respect to merchandise that was the subject merchandise of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a countervailing duty order that was revoked under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed, or</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Producers related to foreign producers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining industry support under subparagraph (A), the administering authority shall disregard the position of domestic producers who oppose the petition, if such producers are related to foreign producers, as defined in section 1677(4)(B)(ii) of this title, unless such domestic producers demonstrate that their interests as domestic producers would be adversely affected by the imposition of a countervailing duty order.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Producers who are importers</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for regional industries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition alleges that the industry is a regional industry, the administering authority shall determine whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry by applying subparagraph (A) on the basis of production in the region.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Polling the industry</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition does not establish support of domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, the administering authority shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if there is support for the petition as required by subparagraph (A), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if there is a large number of producers in the industry, the administering authority may determine industry support for the petition by using any statistically valid sampling method to poll the industry.</p>

After the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, the determination regarding industry support shall not be reconsidered.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) "Domestic producers or workers" defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term "domestic producers or workers" means those interested parties who are eligible to file a petition under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notify the Commission immediately of any determination it makes under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the determination is affirmative, make available to the Commission such information as it may have relating to the matter under investigation, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Information regarding critical circumstances</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time after the initiation of an investigation under this part, the administering authority finds a reasonable basis to suspect that the alleged countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, the administering authority may request the Commissioner of Customs to compile information on an expedited basis regarding entries of the subject merchandise. Upon receiving such request, the Commissioner of Customs shall collect information regarding the volume and value of entries of the subject merchandise and shall transmit such information to the administering authority at such times as the administering authority shall direct (at least once every 30 days), until a final determination is made under section 1671d(a) of this title, the investigation is terminated, or the administering authority withdraws the request.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of a petition dismissed by the administering authority under section 1671a(c)(3) of this title, the Commission, within the time specified in paragraph (2), shall determine, based on the information available to it at the time of the determination, whether there is a reasonable indication that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time for Commission determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make the determination described in paragraph (1)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an investigation initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, within 45 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority that an investigation has been initiated under such section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preliminary determination by administering authority; expedited determinations; waiver of verification</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, but not before an affirmative determination by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the administering authority shall make a determination, based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the petition is one subject to section 1671a(b)(3) of this title, the Administering Authority shall, taking into account the nature of the countervailable subsidy concerned, make the determination required by paragraph (1) on an expedited basis and within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title unless the provisions of subsection (c) of this section apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 55 days after the initiation of an investigation the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 50 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title. Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made on an expedited basis on the basis of the record established during the first 50 days after the investigation was initiated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administering authority concludes that the parties concerned are cooperating and determines that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the number and complexity of the alleged countervailable subsidy practices;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the novelty of the issues presented;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the need to determine the extent to which particular countervailable subsidies are used by individual manufacturers, producers, and exporters; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if section 1677f&#8211;1(e)(2)(B) of this title applies, determine a single estimated country-wide subsidy rate, applicable to all exporters and producers, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate, the estimated all-others rate, or the estimated country-wide subsidy rate, whichever is applicable,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall take into account&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior consultations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority determines that extraordinary circumstances are present in a case, it may suspend an investigation upon the acceptance of an agreement from a government described in subsection (b) of this section, or from exporters described in subsection (b) of this section, if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of exports to the United States of the subject merchandise.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain additional requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition alleges the industry is a regional industry, the administering authority shall determine whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry by applying subparagraph (A) on the basis of production in the region.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Polling the industry</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition does not establish support of domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, the administering authority shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time for Commission determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make the determination described in paragraph (1)&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) If certain short life cycle merchandise involved</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a petition filed under section 1673a(b) of this title, or an investigation initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title, concerns short life cycle merchandise that is included in a product category established under section 1673h(a) of this title, subparagraph (A) shall be applied&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 75 days after the initiation of an investigation, the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 60 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title. Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a preliminary determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made within 90 days after the initiation of the investigation on the basis of the record established during the first 60 days after the investigation was initiated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall make available to the Commission all information upon which such determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its injury determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The instructions of the administering authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) may not remain in effect for more than 4 months, except that the administering authority may, at the request of exporters representing a significant proportion of exports of the subject merchandise, extend that 4-month period to not more than 6 months.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a petitioner alleges critical circumstances in its original petition, or by amendment at any time more than 20 days before the date of a final determination by the administering authority, then the administering authority shall promptly (at any time after the initiation of the investigation under this part) determine, on the basis of the information available to it at that time, whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest the administering authority shall take into account&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the antidumping order will be seriously undermined.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of the imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) of this section would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of initiation of review</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 days before the fifth anniversary of the date described in paragraph (1), the administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of initiation of a review under this subsection and request that interested parties submit&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Five-year reviews</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a review conducted under subsection (c) of this section, the administering authority shall revoke a countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, unless&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Determination that basis for suspension no longer exists</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If the determination of the Commission under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section is negative, the suspension agreement shall be treated as not accepted, beginning on the date of publication of the Commission's determination, and the administering authority and the Commission shall proceed, under section 1671c(i) or 1673c(i) of this title, as if the suspension agreement had been violated on that date, except that no duty under any order subsequently issued shall be assessed on merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) no review pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section is in progress,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the administering authority shall conduct a review of the order or suspended investigation to determine whether the subject merchandise benefits from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement. If the administering authority determines that the subject merchandise is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program, it shall make appropriate adjustments in the estimated duty to be deposited or appropriate revisions to the terms of the suspension agreement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withdrawal of subsidy or imposition of countermeasures</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that, pursuant to Article 4 or Article 7 of the Subsidies Agreement&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the United States has imposed countermeasures, and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1675a &#183; Special rules for section 1675(b) and 1675(c) reviews</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of material injury</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review conducted under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission shall determine whether revocation of an order, or termination of a suspended investigation, would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time. The Commission shall consider the likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The Commission shall take into account&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) its prior injury determinations, including the volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry before the order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether any improvement in the state of the industry is related to the order or the suspension agreement,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the industry is vulnerable to material injury if the order is revoked or the suspension agreement is terminated, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in an antidumping proceeding under section 1675(c) of this title, the findings of the administering authority regarding duty absorption under section 1675(a)(4) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Volume</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be significant if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States. In so doing, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors, including&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any likely increase in production capacity or existing unused production capacity in the exporting country,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) existing inventories of the subject merchandise, or likely increases in inventories,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the existence of barriers to the importation of such merchandise into countries other than the United States, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Price</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely price effects of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is likely to be significant price underselling by imports of the subject merchandise as compared to domestic like products, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) imports of the subject merchandise are likely to enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of domestic like products.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Impact on the industry</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) likely declines in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization of capacity,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) likely negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) likely negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this paragraph within the context of the business cycle and the conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Basis for determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under this subsection shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the Commission's determination of whether material injury is likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. In making that determination, the Commission shall consider that the effects of revocation or termination may not be imminent, but may manifest themselves only over a longer period of time.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Magnitude of margin of dumping and net countervailable subsidy; nature of countervailable subsidy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission may consider the magnitude of the margin of dumping or the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy. If a countervailable subsidy is involved the Commission shall consider information regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Cumulation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which reviews under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title were initiated on the same day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market. The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effects of imports of the subject merchandise in a case in which it determines that such imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special rule for regional industries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title involving a regional industry, the Commission may base its determination on the regional industry defined in the original investigation under this subtitle, another region that satisfies the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title, or the United States as a whole. In determining if a regional industry analysis is appropriate for the determination in the review, the Commission shall consider whether the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title are likely to be satisfied if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title, the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1671c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy. The administering authority shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the net countervailable subsidy determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether any change in the program which gave rise to the net countervailable subsidy described in subparagraph (A) has occurred that is likely to affect that net countervailable subsidy.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of other factors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) programs determined to provide countervailable subsidies in other investigations or reviews under this subtitle, but only to the extent that such programs&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) can potentially be used by the exporters or producers subject to the review under section 1675(c) of this title, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) did not exist at the time that the countervailing duty order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) programs newly alleged to provide countervailable subsidies but only to the extent that the administering authority makes an affirmative countervailing duty determination with respect to such programs and with respect to the exporters or producers subject to the review.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Net countervailable subsidy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under section 1671d of this title or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Treatment of zero and de minimis rates</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A net countervailable subsidy described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering authority to determine that revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of de minimis standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the administering authority shall apply the de minimis standards applicable to reviews conducted under subsections (a) and (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title, the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of an antidumping duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1673c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of sales of the subject merchandise at less than fair value. The administering authority shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the weighted average dumping margins determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the volume of imports of the subject merchandise for the period before and the period after the issuance of the antidumping duty order or acceptance of the suspension agreement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of other factors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider such other price, cost, market, or economic factors as it deems relevant.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Magnitude of the margin of dumping</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the magnitude of the margin of dumping that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a margin that was determined under section 1673d of this title or under subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Treatment of zero or de minimis margins</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A dumping margin described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering authority to determine that revocation of an antidumping duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of sales at less than fair value.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of de minimis standards</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Industry</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term "industry" means the producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Related parties</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If a producer of a domestic like product and an exporter or importer of the subject merchandise are related parties, or if a producer of the domestic like product is also an importer of the subject merchandise, the producer may, in appropriate circumstances, be excluded from the industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), a producer and an exporter or importer shall be considered to be related parties, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the exporter or importer directly or indirectly controls the producer,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a third party directly or indirectly controls the producer and the exporter or importer, or</p>

If the domestic production of the domestic like product has no separate identity in terms of such criteria, then the effect of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes a domestic like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Industry producing processed agricultural products</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides any form of income or price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) makes a payment to a funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution, or entrusts or directs a private entity to make a financial contribution, if providing the contribution would normally be vested in the government and the practice does not differ in substance from practices normally followed by governments,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a loan, if there is a difference between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on the market,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of a loan guarantee, if there is a difference, after adjusting for any difference in guarantee fees, between the amount the recipient of the guarantee pays on the guaranteed loan and the amount the recipient would pay for a comparable commercial loan if there were no guarantee by the authority, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in the case where goods or services are provided, if such goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration, and in the case where goods are purchased, if such goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Change in ownership</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable, even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm's length transaction.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5A) Specificity</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A subsidy is specific if it is an export subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or an import substitution subsidy described in subparagraph (C), or if it is determined to be specific pursuant to subparagraph (D).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Export subsidy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">An export subsidy is a subsidy that is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Import substitution subsidy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">An import substitution subsidy is a subsidy that is contingent upon the use of domestic goods over imported goods, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether a subsidy (other than a subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or (C)) is a specific subsidy, in law or in fact, to an enterprise or industry within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the following guidelines shall apply:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, expressly limits access to the subsidy to an enterprise or industry, the subsidy is specific as a matter of law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, the subsidy is not specific as a matter of law, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) eligibility is automatic,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the criteria or conditions for eligibility are strictly followed, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the criteria or conditions are clearly set forth in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;For purposes of this clause, the term "objective criteria or conditions" means criteria or conditions that are neutral and that do not favor one enterprise or industry over another.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Where there are reasons to believe that a subsidy may be specific as a matter of fact, the subsidy is specific if one or more of the following factors exist:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The actual recipients of the subsidy, whether considered on an enterprise or industry basis, are limited in number.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) An enterprise or industry is a predominant user of the subsidy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) An enterprise or industry receives a disproportionately large amount of the subsidy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) The manner in which the authority providing the subsidy has exercised discretion in the decision to grant the subsidy indicates that an enterprise or industry is favored over others.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;In evaluating the factors set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), and (IV), the administering authority shall take into account the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, and the length of time during which the subsidy program has been in operation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Where a subsidy is limited to an enterprise or industry located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the subsidy is specific.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (5B), any reference to an enterprise or industry is a reference to a foreign enterprise or foreign industry and includes a group of such enterprises or industries.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5B) Categories of noncountervailable subsidies</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (5A), in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, a subsidy shall be treated as noncountervailable if the administering authority determines in an investigation under part I of this subtitle or a review under part III of this subtitle that the subsidy meets all of the criteria described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), as the case may be, or the provisions of subparagraph (E)(i) apply.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Research subsidy</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except for a subsidy provided on the manufacture, production, or export of civil aircraft, a subsidy for research activities conducted by a person, or by a higher education or research establishment on a contract basis with a person, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy covers not more than 75 percent of the costs of industrial research or not more than 50 percent of the costs of precompetitive development activity, and such subsidy is limited exclusively to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the costs of researchers, technicians, and other supporting staff employed exclusively in the research activity,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs of instruments, equipment, land, or buildings that are used exclusively and permanently (except when disposed of on a commercial basis) for the research activity,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the costs of consultancy and equivalent services used exclusively for the research activity, including costs for bought-in research, technical knowledge, and patents,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) additional overhead costs incurred directly as a result of the research activity, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) other operating costs (such as materials and supplies) incurred directly as a result of the research activity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term "precompetitive development activity" means the translation of industrial research findings into a plan, blueprint, or design for new, modified, or improved products, processes, or services, whether intended for sale or use, including the creation of a first prototype that would not be capable of commercial use. The term also may include the conceptual formulation and design of products, processes, or services alternatives and initial demonstration or pilot projects, if these same projects cannot be converted or used for industrial application or commercial exploitation. The term does not include routine or periodic alterations to existing products, production lines, manufacturing processes, services, or other ongoing operations even if those alterations may represent improvements.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Calculation rules</h4>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of a research activity that spans both industrial research and precompetitive development activity, the allowable level of the noncountervailable subsidy shall not exceed 62.5 percent of the costs set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), and (V) of clause (i).</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Total eligible costs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The allowable level of a noncountervailable subsidy described in clause (i) shall be based on the total eligible costs incurred over the duration of a particular project.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy provided, pursuant to a general framework of regional development, to a person located in a disadvantaged region within a country shall be treated as noncountervailable, if it is not specific (within the meaning of paragraph (5A)) within eligible regions and if the following conditions are met:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Each region identified as disadvantaged within the territory of a country is a clearly designated, contiguous geographical area with a definable economic and administrative identity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Each region is considered a disadvantaged region on the basis of neutral and objective criteria indicating that the region is disadvantaged because of more than temporary circumstances, and such criteria are clearly stated in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) The criteria described in subclause (II) include a measurement of economic development.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) Programs provided within a general framework of regional development include ceilings on the amount of assistance that can be granted to a subsidized project. Such ceilings are differentiated according to the different levels of development of assisted regions, and are expressed in terms of investment costs or costs of job creation. Within such ceilings, the distribution of assistance is sufficiently broad and even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or the provision of disproportionately large amounts of a subsidy to, an enterprise or industry as described in paragraph (5A)(D).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Measurement of economic development</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the measurement of economic development shall be based on one or more of the following factors:</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Subsidy for adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy that is provided to promote the adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements that are imposed by statute or by regulation, and that result in greater constraints and financial burdens on the recipient of the subsidy, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is a one-time nonrecurring measure,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is limited to 20 percent of the cost of adaptation,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) does not cover the cost of replacing and operating the subsidized investment, a cost that must be fully borne by the recipient,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) is directly linked and proportionate to the recipient's planned reduction of nuisances and pollution, and does not cover any manufacturing cost savings that may be achieved, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the subsidy is specific within the meaning of paragraph (5A).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain subsidies on agricultural products</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Domestic support measures that are provided with respect to products listed in Annex 1 to the Agreement on Agriculture, and that the administering authority determines conform fully to the provisions of Annex 2 to that Agreement, shall be treated as noncountervailable.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall consider&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the volume of imports of the subject merchandise,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the effect of imports of that merchandise on prices in the United States for domestic like products, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of domestic like products, but only in the context of production operations within the United States; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may consider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination regarding whether there is material injury by reason of imports.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the notification required under section 1671d(d) or 1673d(d) of this title, as the case may be, the Commission shall explain its analysis of each factor considered under clause (i), and identify each factor considered under clause (ii) and explain in full its relevance to the determination.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Evaluation of relevant factors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (B)&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Volume</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In evaluating the volume of imports of merchandise, the Commission shall consider whether the volume of imports of the merchandise, or any increase in that volume, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, is significant.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Price</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In evaluating the effect of imports of such merchandise on prices, the Commission shall consider whether&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Impact on affected domestic industry</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In examining the impact required to be considered under subparagraph (B)(i)(III), the Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization of capacity,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) factors affecting domestic prices,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) in a proceeding under part II of this subtitle, the magnitude of the margin of dumping.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this clause within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Captive production</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If domestic producers internally transfer significant production of the domestic like product for the production of a downstream article and sell significant production of the domestic like product in the merchant market, and the Commission finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the domestic like product produced that is internally transferred for processing into that downstream article does not enter the merchant market for the domestic like product,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the domestic like product is the predominant material input in the production of that downstream article, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the production of the domestic like product sold in the merchant market is not generally used in the production of that downstream article,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;then the Commission, in determining market share and the factors affecting financial performance set forth in clause (iii), shall focus primarily on the merchant market for the domestic like product.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rules for agricultural products</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The Commission shall not determine that there is no material injury or threat of material injury to United States producers of an agricultural commodity merely because the prevailing market price is at or above the minimum support price.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In the case of agricultural products, the Commission shall consider any increased burden on government income or price support programs.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rules</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Nature of countervailable subsidy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining whether there is a threat of material injury, the Commission shall consider information provided to it by the administering authority regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy granted by a foreign country (particularly whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement) and the effects likely to be caused by the countervailable subsidy.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Standard for determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate under subparagraph (C) or (D) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination by the Commission of material injury.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Threat of material injury</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other relevant economic factors&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy (particularly as to whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement), and whether imports of the subject merchandise are likely to increase,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) in any investigation under this subtitle which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(E)(iv)) and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 1671d(b)(1) or 1673d(b)(1) of this title with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VIII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IX) any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Basis for determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall consider the factors set forth in clause (i) as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this subtitle. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under clause (i) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Effect of dumping in third-country markets</h4>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">In investigations under part II of this subtitle, the Commission shall consider whether dumping in the markets of foreign countries (as evidenced by dumping findings or antidumping remedies in other WTO member markets against the same class or kind of merchandise manufactured or exported by the same party as under investigation) suggests a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. In the course of its investigation, the Commission shall request information from the foreign manufacturer, exporter, or United States importer concerning this issue.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) WTO member market</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of this clause, the term "WTO member market" means the market of any country which is a WTO member.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;if such imports compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exceptions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports under clause (i)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) with respect to which the administering authority has made a preliminary negative determination, unless the administering authority subsequently made a final affirmative determination with respect to those imports before the Commission's final determination is made;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) from any country with respect to which the investigation has been terminated;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) from any country designated as a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) for purposes of making a determination with respect to that country, except that the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from such country may be cumulatively assessed with imports of the subject merchandise from any other country designated as such a beneficiary country to the extent permitted by clause (i); or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) from any country that is a party to an agreement with the United States establishing a free trade area, which entered into force and effect before January 1, 1987, unless the Commission determines that a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from that country.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Records in final investigations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In each final determination in which it cumulatively assesses the volume and effect of imports under clause (i), the Commission shall make its determinations based on the record compiled in the first investigation in which it makes a final determination, except that when the administering authority issues its final determination in a subsequently completed investigation, the Commission shall permit the parties in the subsequent investigation to submit comments concerning the significance of the administering authority's final determination, and shall include such comments and the administering authority's final determination in the record for the subsequent investigation.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Regional industry determinations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In an investigation which involves a regional industry, and in which the Commission decides that the volume and effect of imports should be cumulatively assessed under this subparagraph, such assessment shall be based upon the volume and effect of imports into the region or regions determined by the Commission. The provisions of clause (iii) shall apply to such investigations.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Cumulation for determining threat of material injury</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent practicable and subject to subparagraph (G)(ii), for purposes of clause (i)(III) and (IV) of subparagraph (F), the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and price effects of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">if such imports compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(I) Consideration of post-petition information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall consider whether any change in the volume, price effects, or impact of imports of the subject merchandise since the filing of the petition in an investigation under part I or II of this subtitle is related to the pendency of the investigation and, if so, the Commission may reduce the weight accorded to the data for the period after the filing of the petition in making its determination of material injury, threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Constructed export price</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The term "constructed export price" means the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) in the United States before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter, as adjusted under subsections (c) and (d) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments for export price and constructed export price</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The price used to establish export price and constructed export price shall be&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of any countervailing duty imposed on the subject merchandise under part I of this subtitle to offset an export subsidy, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reduced by&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule for merchandise with value added after importation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Where the subject merchandise is imported by a person affiliated with the exporter or producer, and the value added in the United States by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise, the administering authority shall determine the constructed export price for such merchandise by using one of the following prices if there is a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison and the administering authority determines that the use of such sales is appropriate:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The price of identical subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The price of other subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If there is not a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison under paragraph (1) or (2), or the administering authority determines that neither of the prices described in such paragraphs is appropriate, then the constructed export price may be determined on any other reasonable basis.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (d)(3) of this section, profit shall be an amount determined by multiplying the total actual profit by the applicable percentage.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1677b &#183; Normal value</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In determining under this subtitle whether subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value, a fair comparison shall be made between the export price or constructed export price and normal value. In order to achieve a fair comparison with the export price or constructed export price, normal value shall be determined as follows:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of normal value</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The normal value of the subject merchandise shall be the price described in subparagraph (B), at a time reasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to determine the export price or constructed export price under section 1677a(a) or (b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Price</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The price referred to in subparagraph (A) is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the price at which the foreign like product is first sold (or, in the absence of a sale, offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in a case to which subparagraph (C) applies, the price at which the foreign like product is so sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in a country other than the exporting country or the United States, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such price is representative,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold by the exporter or producer in such other country is 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or value) of the subject merchandise sold in the United States or for export to the United States, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the administering authority does not determine that the particular market situation in such other country prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Third country sales</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">This subparagraph applies when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the foreign like product is not sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country as described in subparagraph (B)(i),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the administering authority determines that the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country is insufficient to permit a proper comparison with the sales of the subject merchandise to the United States, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the particular market situation in the exporting country does not permit a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clause (ii), the aggregate quantity (or value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country shall normally be considered to be insufficient if such quantity (or value) is less than 5 percent of the aggregate quantity (or value) of sales of the subject merchandise to the United States.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fictitious markets</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">No pretended sale or offer for sale, and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish a fictitious market, shall be taken into account in determining normal value. The occurrence of different movements in the prices at which different forms of the foreign like product are sold (or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale) in the exporting country after the issuance of an antidumping duty order may be considered by the administering authority as evidence of the establishment of a fictitious market for the foreign like product if the movement in such prices appears to reduce the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the subject merchandise.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exportation from an intermediate country</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the subject merchandise is exported to the United States from an intermediate country, normal value shall be determined in the intermediate country, except that normal value may be determined in the country of origin of the subject merchandise if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the producer knew at the time of the sale that the subject merchandise was destined for exportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the subject merchandise is merely transshipped through the intermediate country;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sales of the foreign like product in the intermediate country do not satisfy the conditions of paragraph (1)(C); or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the foreign like product is not produced in the intermediate country.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of constructed value</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority determines that the normal value of the subject merchandise cannot be determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i), then, notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the normal value of the subject merchandise may be the constructed value of that merchandise, as determined under subsection (e) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Indirect sales or offers for sale</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the foreign like product is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale through an affiliated party, the prices at which the foreign like product is sold (or offered for sale) by such affiliated party may be used in determining normal value.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Adjustments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increased by the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduced by&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) when included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount, if any, included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), attributable to any additional costs, charges, and expenses incident to bringing the foreign like product from the original place of shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amount of any taxes imposed directly upon the foreign like product or components thereof which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, on the subject merchandise, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of the foreign like product, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increased or decreased by the amount of any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise provided under this section) that is established to the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or partly due to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the fact that the quantities in which the subject merchandise is sold or agreed to be sold to the United States are greater than or less than the quantities in which the foreign like product is sold, agreed to be sold, or offered for sale,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fact that merchandise described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 1677(16) of this title is used in determining normal value, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) other differences in the circumstances of sale.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Additional adjustments</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Level of trade</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall also be increased or decreased to make due allowance for any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise made under this section) that is shown to be wholly or partly due to a difference in level of trade between the export price or constructed export price and normal value, if the difference in level of trade&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) involves the performance of different selling activities; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In a case described in the preceding sentence, the amount of the adjustment shall be based on the price differences between the two levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Constructed export price offset</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">When normal value is established at a level of trade which constitutes a more advanced stage of distribution than the level of trade of the constructed export price, but the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine under subparagraph (A)(ii) a level of trade adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under section 1677a(d)(1)(D) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Adjustments to constructed value</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Constructed value as determined under subsection (e) of this section, may be adjusted, as appropriate, pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sales at less than cost of production</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination; sales disregarded</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of that product, the administering authority shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of production. If the administering authority determines that sales made at less than the cost of production&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have been made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) were not at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such sales may be disregarded in the determination of normal value. Whenever such sales are disregarded, normal value shall be based on the remaining sales of the foreign like product in the ordinary course of trade. If no sales made in the ordinary course of trade remain, the normal value shall be based on the constructed value of the merchandise.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions and special rules</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reasonable grounds to believe or suspect</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">There are reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product were made at prices that are less than the cost of production of the product, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in an investigation initiated under section 1673a of this title or a review conducted under section 1675 of this title, an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title provides information, based upon observed prices or constructed prices or costs, that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of the product; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in a review conducted under section 1675 of this title involving a specific exporter, the administering authority disregarded some or all of the exporter's sales pursuant to paragraph (1) in the investigation or if a review has been completed, in the most recently completed review.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extended period of time</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term "extended period of time" means a period that is normally 1 year, but not less than 6 months.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Substantial quantities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Sales made at prices below the cost of production have been made in substantial quantities if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the volume of such sales represents 20 percent or more of the volume of sales under consideration for the determination of normal value, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the weighted average per unit price of the sales under consideration for the determination of normal value is less than the weighted average per unit cost of production for such sales.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Recovery of costs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If prices which are below the per unit cost of production at the time of sale are above the weighted average per unit cost of production for the period of investigation or review, such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Calculation of cost of production</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the cost of production shall be an amount equal to the sum of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of materials and of fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the foreign like product, during a period which would ordinarily permit the production of that foreign like product in the ordinary course of business;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an amount for selling, general, and administrative expenses based on actual data pertaining to production and sales of the foreign like product by the exporter in question; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the normal value is based on the price of the foreign like product sold for consumption in a country other than the exporting country, the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nonmarket economy countries</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the subject merchandise is exported from a nonmarket economy country, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administering authority finds that available information does not permit the normal value of the subject merchandise to be determined under subsection (a) of this section,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the administering authority shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the valuation of the factors of production shall be based on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority finds that the available information is inadequate for purposes of determining the normal value of subject merchandise under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall determine the normal value on the basis of the price at which merchandise that is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comparable to the subject merchandise, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) produced in one or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is sold in other countries, including the United States.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, in determining the normal value of the foreign like product produced in a country outside of the exporting country, the administering authority shall determine its price at the time of exportation from the exporting country and shall make any adjustments required by subsection (a) of this section for the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States by reference to such costs in the exporting country.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Costs</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country (or the producing country, where appropriate) and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise. The administering authority shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a timely basis, if such allocations have been historically used by the exporter or producer, in particular for establishing appropriate amortization and depreciation periods, and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonrecurring costs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those nonrecurring costs that benefit current or future production, or both.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Startup costs</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for circumstances in which costs incurred during the time period covered by the investigation or review are affected by startup operations.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Startup operations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Adjustments shall be made for startup operations only where&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a producer is using new production facilities or producing a new product that requires substantial additional investment, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) production levels are limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;For purposes of subclause (II), the initial phase of commercial production ends at the end of the startup period. In determining whether commercial production levels have been achieved, the administering authority shall consider factors unrelated to startup operations that might affect the volume of production processed, such as demand, seasonality, or business cycles.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustment for startup operations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The adjustment for startup operations shall be made by substituting the unit production costs incurred with respect to the merchandise at the end of the startup period for the unit production costs incurred during the startup period. If the startup period extends beyond the period of the investigation or review under this subtitle, the administering authority shall use the most recent cost of production data that it reasonably can obtain, analyze, and verify without delaying the timely completion of the investigation or review. For purposes of this subparagraph, the startup period ends at the point at which the level of commercial production that is characteristic of the merchandise, producer, or industry concerned is achieved.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transactions disregarded</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A transaction directly or indirectly between affiliated persons may be disregarded if, in the case of any element of value required to be considered, the amount representing that element does not fairly reflect the amount usually reflected in sales of merchandise under consideration in the market under consideration. If a transaction is disregarded under the preceding sentence and no other transactions are available for consideration, the determination of the amount shall be based on the information available as to what the amount would have been if the transaction had occurred between persons who are not affiliated.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Major input rule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the case of a transaction between affiliated persons involving the production by one of such persons of a major input to the merchandise, the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an amount represented as the value of such input is less than the cost of production of such input, then the administering authority may determine the value of the major input on the basis of the information available regarding such cost of production, if such cost is greater than the amount that would be determined for such input under paragraph (2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In an antidumping proceeding under this subtitle, the administering authority shall convert foreign currencies into United States dollars using the exchange rate in effect on the date of sale of the subject merchandise, except that, if it is established that a currency transaction on forward markets is directly linked to an export sale under consideration, the exchange rate specified with respect to such currency in the forward sale agreement shall be used to convert the foreign currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates shall be ignored.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sustained movement in foreign currency value</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In an investigation under part II of this subtitle, if there is a sustained movement in the value of the foreign currency relative to the United States dollar, the administering authority shall allow exporters at least 60 days to adjust their export prices to reflect such sustained movement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the administering authority and the Commission shall each hold a hearing in the course of an investigation upon the request of any party to the investigation before making a final determination under section 1671d or 1673d of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If investigations are initiated under part I and part II of this subtitle regarding the same merchandise from the same country within 6 months of each other (but before a final determination is made in either investigation), the holding of a hearing by the Commission in the course of one of the investigations shall be treated as compliance with paragraph (1) for both investigations, unless the Commission considers that special circumstances require that a hearing be held in the course of each of the investigations. During any investigation regarding which the holding of a hearing is waived under this paragraph, the Commission shall allow any party to submit such additional written comment as it considers relevant.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any hearing required or permitted under this subtitle shall be conducted after notice published in the Federal Register, and a transcript of the hearing shall be prepared and made available to the public.

<p class="statutory-body">If the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from the administering authority or the Commission, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be), in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle, may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.

Unless that person persuades the administering authority or the Commission that the designation is warranted, or withdraws the designation, the administering authority or the Commission, as the case may be, shall return it to the party submitting it. In a case in which the administering authority or the Commission returns the information to the person submitting it, the person may thereafter submit other material concerning the subject matter of the returned information if the submission is made within the time otherwise provided for submitting such material.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A decision concerning the disclosure or nondisclosure of material under protective order by the administering authority or the Commission shall not be subject to judicial review, and no court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review such decision on any question of law or fact by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents of protective order</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each protective order issued under this subsection shall be in such form and contain such requirements as the administering authority or the Commission may determine by regulation to be appropriate.

The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. The amount of such civil penalty and other sanctions shall be assessed by the administering authority or the Commission by written notice, except that assessment shall be made by the administering authority for violation, inducement of a violation or receipt of information with reason to know that such information was disclosed in violation, of an undertaking entered into by any person with an authorized agency of a free trade area country (as defined in section 1516a(f)(10) of this title).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Selection of averages and samples</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The authority to select averages and statistically valid samples shall rest exclusively with the administering authority.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If it is not practicable to make individual weighted average dumping margin determinations under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may determine the weighted average dumping margins for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority may determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise, if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a pattern of export prices (or constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the administering authority can reasonably estimate the extent to which the countervailable subsidy referred to in subparagraph (B), in combination with the use of normal value determined pursuant to section 1677b(c) of this title, has increased the weighted average dumping margin for the class or kind of merchandise,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the administering authority shall, except as provided in paragraph (2), reduce the antidumping duty by the amount of the increase in the weighted average dumping margin estimated by the administering authority under subparagraph (C).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2112 &#183; Barriers to and other distortions of trade</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; directives; disavowal of prior approval of legislation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade are reducing the growth of foreign markets for the products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, diminishing the intended mutual benefits of reciprocal trade concessions, adversely affecting the United States economy, preventing fair and equitable access to supplies, and preventing the development of open and nondiscriminatory trade among nations. The President is urged to take all appropriate and feasible steps within his power (including the full exercise of the rights of the United States under international agreements) to harmonize, reduce, or eliminate such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. The President is further urged to utilize the authority granted by subsection (b) of this section to negotiate trade agreements with other countries and instrumentalities providing on a basis of mutuality for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prior approval of any legislation which may be necessary to implement an agreement concerning barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presidential determinations prerequisite to entry into trade agreements; trade with Israel</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the President determines that any barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade of any foreign country or the United States unduly burden and restrict the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affect the United States economy, or that the imposition of such barriers is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, and that the purposes of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President, during the 13-year period beginning on January 3, 1975, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers (or other distortions) or providing for the prohibition of or limitations on the imposition of such barriers (or other distortions).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Trade agreements that provide for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) only with Israel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The negotiation of any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States shall take fully into account any product that benefits from a discriminatory preferential tariff arrangement between Israel and a third country if the tariff preference on such product has been the subject of a challenge by the United States Government under the authority of section 2411 of this title and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the requirements of subsections (c) and (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no trade benefit shall be extended to any country by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to another country under a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with such other country that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a trade agreement that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) with any country other than Israel if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such country requested the negotiation of such an agreement, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the President, at least 60 days prior to the date notice is provided under subsection (e)(1) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) provides written notice of such negotiations to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) consults with such committees regarding the negotiation of such agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of section 2191 of this title shall not apply to an implementing bill (within the meaning of section 2191(b) of this title) if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such implementing bill contains a provision approving of any trade agreement which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) is entered into under this section with any country other than Israel, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) either&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the requirements of subparagraph (A) were not met with respect to the negotiation of such agreement, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives disapproved of the negotiation of such agreement before the close of the 60-day period which begins on the date notice is provided under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) with respect to the negotiation of such agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The 60-day period described in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii)(II) shall be computed without regard to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the days on which either House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain or an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any Saturday and Sunday, not excluded under clause (i), when either House of Congress is not in session.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Presidential consultation with Congress prior to entry into trade agreements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Before the President enters into any trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, and with each committee of the House and the Senate and each joint committee of the Congress which has jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such trade agreement. Such consultation shall include all matters relating to the implementation of such trade agreement as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section. If it is proposed to implement such trade agreement, together with one or more other trade agreements entered into under this section, in a single implementing bill, such consultation shall include the desirability and feasibility of such proposed implementation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Submission to Congress of agreements, drafts of implementing bills, and statements of proposed administrative action</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President enters into a trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall submit such agreement, together with a draft of an implementing bill (described in section 2191(b) of this title) and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, to the Congress as provided in subsection (e) of this section, and such agreement shall enter into force with respect to the United States only if the provisions of subsection (e) of this section are complied with and the implementing bill submitted by the President is enacted into law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the implementing bill is enacted into law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Obligations imposed upon foreign countries or instrumentalities receiving benefits under trade agreements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">To insure that a foreign country or instrumentality which receives benefits under a trade agreement entered into under this section is subject to the obligations imposed by such agreement, the President may recommend to Congress in the implementing bill and statement of administrative action submitted with respect to such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement apply solely to the parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement. The President may also recommend with respect to any such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement not apply uniformly to all parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to cooperate with other countries in correcting an international balance-of-payments disequilibrium,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the President shall proclaim, for a period not exceeding 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a temporary import surcharge, not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem, in the form of duties (in addition to those already imposed, if any) on articles imported into the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) temporary limitations through the use of quotas on the importation of articles into the United States; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) both a temporary import surcharge described in subparagraph (A) and temporary limitations described in subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The authority delegated under subparagraph (B) (and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates to subparagraph (B)) may be exercised (i) only if international trade or monetary agreements to which the United States is a party permit the imposition of quotas as a balance-of-payments measure, and (ii) only to the extent that the fundamental imbalance cannot be dealt with effectively by a surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C). Any temporary import surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C) shall be treated as a regular customs duty.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Import restrictions not imposed when contrary to national interest of United States</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If the President determines that the imposition of import restrictions under subsection (a) of this section will be contrary to the national interest of the United States, then he may refrain from proclaiming such restrictions and he shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) immediately inform Congress of his determination, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) immediately convene the group of congressional official advisers designated under section 2211(a) of this title and consult with them as to the reasons for such determination.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Presidential proclamations liberalizing imports</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President determines that fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to increase imports&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to deal with large and persistent United States balance-of-trade surpluses, as determined on the basis of the cost-insurance-freight value of imports, as reported by the Bureau of the Census, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent significant appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the President is authorized to proclaim, for a period of 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a temporary reduction (of not more than 5 percent ad valorem) in the rate of duty on any article; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a temporary increase in the value or quantity of articles which may be imported under any import restriction, or a temporary suspension of any import restriction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Import liberalizing actions proclaimed pursuant to this subsection shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except that the President shall not proclaim measures under this subsection with respect to those articles where in his judgment such action will cause or contribute to material injury to firms or workers in any domestic industry, including agriculture, mining, fishing, or commerce, or to impairment of the national security, or will otherwise be contrary to the national interest.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nondiscriminatory treatment of import restricting actions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be applied consistently with the principle of nondiscriminatory treatment. In addition, any quota proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subsection (a) of this section shall be applied on a basis which aims at a distribution of trade with the United States approaching as closely as possible that which various foreign countries might have expected to obtain in the absence of such restrictions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President determines that the purposes of this section will best be served by action against one or more countries having large or persistent balance-of-payments surpluses, he may exempt all other countries from such action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) After such time when there enters into force for the United States new rules regarding the application of surcharges as part of a reform of internationally agreed balance-of-payments adjustment procedures, the exemption authority contained in paragraph (2) shall be applied consistently with such new international rules.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) It is the sense of Congress that the President seek modifications in international agreements aimed at allowing the use of surcharges in place of quantitative restrictions (and providing rules to govern the use of such surcharges) as a balance-of-payments adjustment measure within the context of arrangements for an equitable sharing of balance-of-payments adjustment responsibility among deficit and surplus countries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Broad and uniform application of import restricting actions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except where the President determines, consistently with the purposes of this section, that certain articles should not be subject to import restricting actions because of the needs of the United States economy. Such exceptions shall be limited to the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the necessary importation of raw materials, avoiding serious dislocations in the supply of imported goods, and other similar factors. In addition, uniform exceptions may be made where import restricting actions will be unnecessary or ineffective in carrying out the purposes of this section, such as with respect to articles already subject to import restrictions, goods in transit, or goods under binding contract. Neither the authorization of import restricting actions nor the determination of exceptions with respect to product coverage shall be made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic industries from import competition.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Quantitative limitations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any quantitative limitation proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (a) of this section on the quantity or value, or both, of an article&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall permit the importation of a quantity or value which is not less than the quantity or value of such article imported into the United States from the foreign countries to which such limitation applies during the most recent period which the President determines is representative of imports of such article, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall take into account any increase since the end of such representative period in domestic consumption of such article and like or similar articles of domestic manufacture or production.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Suspension, modification, or termination of proclamations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The President may at any time, consistent with the provisions of this section, suspend, modify, or terminate, in whole or in part, any proclamation under this section either during the initial 150-day period of effectiveness or as extended by subsequent Act of Congress.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Termination of tariff concessions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No provision of law authorizing the termination of tariff concessions shall be used to impose a surcharge on imports into the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities for the purpose of granting new concessions as compensation in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may proclaim such modification or continuance of any existing duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such agreement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reductions in rates of duty</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) No proclamation shall be made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section decreasing any rate of duty to a rate which is less than 70 percent of the existing rate of duty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Where the rate of duty in effect at any time is an intermediate stage under section 2902(a) of this title, the proclamation made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may provide for the reduction of each rate of duty at each such stage proclaimed under such section 2902(a) of this title by not more than 30 percent of such rate of duty, and may provide for a final rate of duty which is not less than 70 percent of the rate of duty proclaimed as the final stage under such section 2902(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to an article, he may exceed the limitations provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection by not more than the lesser of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the difference between such limitation and the next lower whole number, or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consideration of past violations of trade concessions</h4>

<h3 class="part-head">Part 1&#8212;Positive Adjustment by Industries Injured by Imports</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2251 &#183; Action to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential action</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If the United States International Trade Commission (hereinafter referred to in this part as the "Commission") determines under section 2252(b) of this title that an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article, the President, in accordance with this part, shall take all appropriate and feasible action within his power which the President determines will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Positive adjustment to import competition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this part, a positive adjustment to import competition occurs when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the domestic industry&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is able to compete successfully with imports after actions taken under section 2254 of this title terminate, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the domestic industry experiences an orderly transfer of resources to other productive pursuits; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) dislocated workers in the industry experience an orderly transition to productive pursuits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The domestic industry may be considered to have made a positive adjustment to import competition even though the industry is not of the same size and composition as the industry at the time the investigation was initiated under section 2252(b) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2252 &#183; Investigations, determinations, and recommendations by Commission</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petitions and adjustment plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition requesting action under this part for the purpose of facilitating positive adjustment to import competition may be filed with the Commission by an entity, including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers, which is representative of an industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) subject to subsection (d)(1)(C)(i) of this section, request provisional relief under subsection (d)(1) of this section; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) request provisional relief under subsection (d)(2) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a petition is filed under paragraph (1), the Commission shall promptly transmit copies of the petition to the Office of the United States Trade Representative and other Federal agencies directly concerned.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A petitioner under paragraph (1) may submit to the Commission and the United States Trade Representative (hereafter in this part referred to as the "Trade Representative"), either with the petition, or at any time within 120 days after the date of filing of the petition, a plan to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Before submitting an adjustment plan under paragraph (4), the petitioner and other entities referred to in paragraph (1) that wish to participate may consult with the Trade Representative and the officers and employees of any Federal agency that is considered appropriate by the Trade Representative, for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of the proposals being considered for inclusion in the plan in relation to specific actions that may be taken under this part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A request for any consultation under subparagraph (A) must be made to the Trade Representative. Upon receiving such a request, the Trade Representative shall confer with the petitioner and provide such assistance, including publication of appropriate notice in the Federal Register, as may be practicable in obtaining other participants in the consultation. No consultation may occur under subparagraph (A) unless the Trade Representative, or his delegate, is in attendance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In the course of any investigation under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall seek information (on a confidential basis, to the extent appropriate) on actions being taken, or planned to be taken, or both, by firms and workers in the industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Regardless whether an adjustment plan is submitted under paragraph (4) by the petitioner, if the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section, any&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) firm in the domestic industry;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) certified or recognized union or group of workers in the domestic industry;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) State or local community;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) trade association representing the domestic industry; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) any other person or group of persons,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">may, individually, submit to the Commission commitments regarding actions such persons and entities intend to take to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in paragraphs (5) and (6) may be construed to provide immunity under the antitrust laws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) The procedures concerning the release of confidential business information set forth in section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332(g)] shall apply with respect to information received by the Commission in the course of investigations conducted under this part, part 1 of title III of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act [19 U.S.C. 3351 et seq.], title II of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act [19 U.S.C. 4051 et seq.], title III of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States&#8211;Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States&#8211;Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act, and title III of the United States&#8211;Panama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. The Commission may request that parties providing confidential business information furnish nonconfidential summaries thereof or, if such parties indicate that the information in the submission cannot be summarized, the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. If the Commission finds that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the party concerned is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summarized form, the Commission may disregard the submission.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigations and determinations by Commission</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a) of this section, the request of the President or the Trade Representative, the resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the Commission shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this section, the term "substantial cause" means a cause which is important and not less than any other cause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 120 days (180 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If before the 100th day after a petition is filed under subsection (a)(1) of this section the Commission determines that the investigation is extraordinarily complicated, the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 150 days (210 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to comment on the adjustment plan, if any, submitted under subsection (a) of this section, to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Factors applied in making determinations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In making determinations under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall take into account all economic factors which it considers relevant, including (but not limited to)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) with respect to serious injury&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the significant idling of productive facilities in the domestic industry,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the inability of a significant number of firms to carry out domestic production operations at a reasonable level of profit, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) significant unemployment or underemployment within the domestic industry;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to threat of serious injury&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a decline in sales or market share, a higher and growing inventory (whether maintained by domestic producers, importers, wholesalers, or retailers), and a downward trend in production, profits, wages, productivity, or employment (or increasing underemployment) in the domestic industry,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the extent to which firms in the domestic industry are unable to generate adequate capital to finance the modernization of their domestic plants and equipment, or are unable to maintain existing levels of expenditures for research and development,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the extent to which the United States market is the focal point for the diversion of exports of the article concerned by reason of restraints on exports of such article to, or on imports of such article into, third country markets; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) with respect to substantial cause, an increase in imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) and a decline in the proportion of the domestic market supplied by domestic producers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making determinations under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the condition of the domestic industry over the course of the relevant business cycle, but may not aggregate the causes of declining demand associated with a recession or economic downturn in the United States economy into a single cause of serious injury or threat of injury; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) examine factors other than imports which may be a cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall include the results of its examination under subparagraph (B) in the report submitted by the Commission to the President under subsection (e) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, in determining the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with an imported article, the Commission&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the extent information is available, shall, in the case of a domestic producer which also imports, treat as part of such domestic industry only its domestic production;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, in the case of a domestic producer which produces more than one article, treat as part of such domestic industry only that portion or subdivision of the producer which produces the like or directly competitive article; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may, in the case of one or more domestic producers which produce a like or directly competitive article in a major geographic area of the United States and whose production facilities in such area for such article constitute a substantial portion of the domestic industry in the United States and primarily serve the market in such area, and where the imports are concentrated in such area, treat as such domestic industry only that segment of the production located in such area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the course of any proceeding under this subsection, the Commission shall investigate any factor which in its judgment may be contributing to increased imports of the article under investigation. Whenever in the course of its investigation the Commission has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable in part to circumstances which come within the purview of subtitles A and B of title VII [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq., 1673 et seq.] or section 337 [19 U.S.C. 1337] of the Tariff Act of 1930, or other remedial provisions of law, the Commission shall promptly notify the appropriate agency so that such action may be taken as is otherwise authorized by such provisions of law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of this section:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The term "domestic industry" means, with respect to an article, the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive article or those producers whose collective production of the like or directly competitive article constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of such article.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term "domestic industry" includes producers located in the United States insular possessions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term "significant idling of productive facilities" includes the closing of plants or the underutilization of production capacity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term "serious injury" means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The term "threat of serious injury" means serious injury that is clearly imminent.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Provisional relief</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) An entity representing a domestic industry that produces a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that is like or directly competitive with an imported perishable agricultural product or citrus product may file a request with the Trade Representative for the monitoring of imports of that product under subparagraph (B). Within 21 days after receiving the request, the Trade Representative shall determine if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the imported product is a perishable agricultural product or citrus product; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there is a reasonable indication that such product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be, or likely to be, a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to such domestic industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Trade Representative shall request, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332(g)], the Commission to monitor and investigate the imports concerned for a period not to exceed 2 years. The monitoring and investigation may include the collection and analysis of information that would expedite an investigation under subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) alleges injury from imports of a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that has been, on the date the allegation is included in the petition, subject to monitoring by the Commission under subparagraph (B) for not less than 90 days; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to such imports;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall, not later than the 21st day after the day on which the request was filed, make a determination, on the basis of available information, whether increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the perishable agricultural product or citrus product are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive perishable product or citrus product, and whether either&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the serious injury cannot be timely prevented through investigation under subsection (b) of this section and action under section 2253 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) At the request of the Commission, the Secretary of Agriculture shall promptly provide to the Commission any relevant information that the Department of Agriculture may have for purposes of making determinations and findings under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Whenever the Commission makes an affirmative preliminary determination under subparagraph (C), the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determination under subparagraph (C) and, if the determination is affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (E).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G) Within 7 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (F) containing an affirmative determination, the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (E), shall proclaim such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section alleges that critical circumstances exist and requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to imports of the article identified in the petition, the Commission shall, not later than 60 days after the petition containing the request was filed, determine, on the basis of available information, whether&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is clear evidence that increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the article are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) delay in taking action under this part would cause damage to that industry that would be difficult to repair.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) and, if the determinations are affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) Within 30 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (C) containing an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii), the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (B), shall proclaim, for a period not to exceed 200 days, such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. Such relief shall take the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If provisional relief is proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D) in the form of an increase, or the imposition of, a duty, the President shall order the suspension of liquidation of all imported articles subject to the affirmative determination under paragraph (1)(C) or paragraph (2)(A), as the case may be, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date of the determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any provisional relief implemented under this subsection with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) if such relief was proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D), the Commission makes a negative determination under subsection (b) of this section regarding injury or the threat thereof by imports of such article;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) action described in section 2253(a)(3)(A) or (C) of this title takes effect under section 2253 of this title with respect to such article;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a decision by the President not to take any action under section 2253(a) of this title with respect to such article becomes final; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) whenever the President determines that, because of changed circumstances, such relief is no longer warranted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any suspension of liquidation ordered under paragraph (3) with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which provisional relief is terminated under subparagraph (A) with respect to the article.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) If an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty that is proclaimed under section 2253 of this title on an imported article is different from a duty increase or imposition that was proclaimed for such an article under this section, then the entry of any such article for which liquidation was suspended under paragraph (3) shall be liquidated at whichever of such rates of duty is lower.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) If provisional relief in the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty is proclaimed under this section with respect to an imported article and neither a duty increase nor a duty imposition is proclaimed under section 2253 of this title regarding such article, the entry of any such article for which liquidation was suspended under paragraph (3) may be liquidated at the rate of duty that applied before provisional relief was provided.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term "citrus product" means any processed oranges or grapefruit, or any orange or grapefruit juice, including concentrate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A perishable agricultural product is any agricultural article, including livestock, regarding which the Trade Representative considers action under this section to be appropriate after taking into account&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) whether the article has&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) a short shelf life,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a short growing season, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a short marketing period,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) whether the article is treated as a perishable product under any other Federal law or regulation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any other factor considered appropriate by the Trade Representative.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Trade Representative is required to take into account under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an article is a perishable agricultural product.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term "provisional relief" means&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any increase in, or imposition of, any duty;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of an article into the United States; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any combination of actions under clauses (i) and (ii).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Commission recommendations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Commission shall also recommend the action that would address the serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry and be most effective in facilitating the efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission is authorized to recommend under paragraph (1)&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) implement any other action authorized under law that is likely to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of making its recommendation under this subsection, the Commission shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) whether international negotiations may be constructive to address the injury or threat thereof or to facilitate adjustment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section are eligible to vote on the recommendation required to be made under paragraph (1) or that may be made under paragraph (3). Members of the Commission who did not agree to the affirmative determination may submit, in the report required under subsection (f) of this section, separate views regarding what action, if any, should be taken under section 2253 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effectiveness of the action taken under section 2253 of this title has been impaired by changed economic circumstances,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">that changed circumstances warrant such reduction, or termination; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determines, after a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry submits to the President a petition requesting such reduction, modification, or termination on such basis, that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President is authorized to take such additional action under section 2253 of this title as may be necessary to eliminate any circumvention of any action previously taken under such section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon request of the President, or upon petition on behalf of the industry concerned filed with the Commission not earlier than the date which is 9 months, and not later than the date which is 6 months, before the date any action taken under section 2253 of this title is to terminate, the Commission shall investigate to determine whether action under section 2253 of this title continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and whether there is evidence that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold a public hearing at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, and to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall transmit to the President a report on its investigation and determination under this subsection not later than 60 days before the action under section 2253 of this title is to terminate, unless the President specifies a different date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such worker's total or partial separation before the worker's application under this part occurred&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on or after the date, as specified in the certification under which the worker is covered, on which total or partial separation began or threatened to begin in the adversely affected employment,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Such worker, with respect to such week of unemployment, would not be disqualified for extended compensation payable under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 by reason of the work acceptance and job search requirements in section 202(a)(3) of such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) in the case of a worker whose most recent total separation from adversely affected employment that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs before the date on which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker, the last day of the 26th week after the date of such certification,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) 45 days after the date specified in subclause (I) or (II), as the case may be, if the Secretary determines there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension in the enrollment period,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) in the case of a worker who fails to enroll by the date required by subclause (I), (II), or (III), as the case may be, due to the failure to provide the worker with timely information regarding the date specified in such subclause, the last day of a period determined by the Secretary, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">no trade readjustment allowance may be paid to the adversely affected worker under this division for the week in which such failure, cessation, or revocation occurred, or any succeeding week, until the adversely affected worker begins or resumes participation in a training program approved under section 2296(a) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waivers of training requirements</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Issuance of waivers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may issue a written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection (a)(5)(A) of this section if the Secretary determines that it is not feasible or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of the following reasons:</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Health</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The worker is unable to participate in training due to the health of the worker, except that a waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation laws.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Enrollment unavailable</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The first available enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is within 60 days after the date of the determination made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Training not available</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Training approved by the Secretary is not reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area career and technical education schools, as defined in section 2302 of title 20, and employers), no training that is suitable for the worker is available at a reasonable cost, or no training funds are available.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duration of waivers</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (3)(B), a waiver issued under paragraph (1) shall be effective for not more than 6 months after the date on which the waiver is issued, unless the Secretary determines otherwise.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revocation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall revoke a waiver issued under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that the basis of a waiver is no longer applicable to the worker and shall notify the worker in writing of the revocation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Agreements under section 2311</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Issuance by cooperating States</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 3 months after the date on which the State issues the waiver; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) on a monthly basis thereafter.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Submission of statements</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adversely affected workers who are undergoing training</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any adversely affected worker who is entitled to trade readjustment allowances and who is undergoing training approved by the Secretary shall receive for each week in which he is undergoing any such training, a trade readjustment allowance in an amount (computed for such week) equal to the amount computed under subsection (a) of this section or (if greater) the amount of any weekly allowance for such training to which he would be entitled under any other Federal law for the training of workers, if he applied for such allowance. Such trade readjustment allowance shall be paid in lieu of any training allowance to which the worker would be entitled under such other Federal law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deduction from total number of weeks of allowance entitlement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If a training allowance under any Federal law other than this chapter is paid to an adversely affected worker for any week of unemployment with respect to which he would be entitled (determined without regard to any disqualification under section 2291(b) of this title) to a trade readjustment allowance if he applied for such allowance, each such week shall be deducted from the total number of weeks of trade readjustment allowance otherwise payable to him under section 2293(a) of this title when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance. If such training allowance paid to such worker for any week of unemployment is less than the amount of the trade readjustment allowance to which he would be entitled if he applied for such allowance, he shall receive, when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance, a trade readjustment allowance for such week equal to such difference.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Election of trade readjustment allowance or unemployment insurance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 2291(a)(3)(B) of this title, an adversely affected worker may elect to receive a trade readjustment allowance instead of unemployment insurance during any week with respect to which the worker&#8212;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maximum allowance; deduction for unemployment insurance; additional payments for approved training periods</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The maximum amount of trade readjustment allowances payable with respect to the period covered by any certification to an adversely affected worker shall be the amount which is the product of 52 multiplied by the trade readjustment allowance payable to the worker for a week of total unemployment (as determined under section 2292(a) of this title), but such product shall be reduced by the total sum of the unemployment insurance to which the worker was entitled (or would have been entitled if he had applied therefor) in the worker's first benefit period described in section 2291(a)(3)(A) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A trade readjustment allowance under paragraph (1) shall not be paid for any week occurring after the close of the 104-week period that begins with the first week following the week in which the adversely affected worker was most recently totally separated from adversely affected employment&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within the period which is described in section 2291(a)(1) of this title, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to which the worker meets the requirements of section 2291(a)(2) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) follows the last week of entitlement to trade readjustment allowances otherwise payable under this part; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) begins with the first week of such training, if such training begins after the last week described in subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments for such additional weeks may be made only for weeks in such 78-week period during which the individual is participating in such training.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments of amounts payable</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Amounts payable to an adversely affected worker under this division shall be subject to such adjustment on a week-to-week basis as may be required by section 2292(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or other Federal law, if the benefit year of a worker ends within an extended benefit period, the number of weeks of extended benefits that such worker would, but for this subsection, be entitled to in that extended benefit period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the number of weeks for which the worker was entitled, during such benefit year, to trade readjustment allowances under this division. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "benefit year" and "extended benefit period" shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Week during which worker received on-the-job training</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No trade readjustment allowance shall be paid to a worker under this division for any week during which the worker is receiving on-the-job training.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the worker was participating in a training program approved under section 2296(a) of this title before the beginning of such break in training, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the break is provided under such training program.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of trade readjustment allowances to complete training</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in order to assist an adversely affected worker to complete training approved for the worker under section 2296 of this title that leads to the completion of a degree or industry-recognized credential, payments may be made as trade readjustment allowances for not more than 13 weeks within such period of eligibility as the Secretary may prescribe to account for a break in training or for justifiable cause that follows the last week for which the worker is otherwise entitled to a trade readjustment allowance under this part if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) payment of the trade readjustment allowance for not more than 13 weeks is necessary for the worker to complete the training;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the worker participates in training in each such week; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the worker&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has substantially met the performance benchmarks established as part of the training approved for the worker;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is expected to continue to make progress toward the completion of the training; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) will complete the training during that period of eligibility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any period during which a judicial or administrative appeal is pending with respect to the denial by the Secretary of a petition under section 2273 of this title shall not be counted for purposes of calculating the period of separation under subsection (a)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that there is justifiable cause, the Secretary may extend the period during which trade readjustment allowances are payable to an adversely affected worker under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) (but not the maximum amounts of such allowances that are payable under this section).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Special rule with respect to military service</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing any service sector access authorization, and in addition to the authority conferred in paragraph (1), the Trade Representative may, for purposes of carrying out the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on a nondiscriminatory basis or solely against the foreign country described in such subsection, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without regard to whether or not such goods or economic sector were involved in the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of such action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any trade agreement described in paragraph (1)(D)(iii) shall provide compensatory trade benefits that benefit the economic sector which includes the domestic industry that would benefit from the elimination of the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of the action to be taken under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or benefit the economic sector as closely related as possible to such economic sector, unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the provision of such trade benefits is not feasible, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) trade benefits that benefit any other economic sector would be more satisfactory than such trade benefits.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) "Emergency condition" defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term "emergency condition" means, with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of any State Party, that such material is&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a newly discovered type of material which is of importance for the understanding of the history of mankind and is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) identifiable as coming from any site recognized to be of high cultural significance if such site is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation which is, or threatens to be, of crisis proportions; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a part of the remains of a particular culture or civilization, the record of which is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation which is, or threatens to be, of crisis proportions;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">and application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title on a temporary basis would, in whole or in part, reduce the incentive for such pillage, dismantling, dispersal or fragmentation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presidential action</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if the President determines that an emergency condition applies with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of any State Party, the President may apply the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title with respect to such material.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President may not implement this section with respect to the archaeological or ethnological materials of any State Party unless the State Party has made a request described in section 2602(a) of this title to the United States and has supplied information which supports a determination that an emergency condition exists.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In taking action under subsection (b) of this section with respect to any State Party, the President shall consider the views and recommendations contained in the Committee report required under section 2605(f)(3) of this title if the report is submitted to the President before the close of the ninety-day period beginning on the day on which the President submitted information to the Committee under section 2602(f)(2) of this title on the request of the State Party under section 2602(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) No import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title may be applied under this section to the archaeological or ethnological materials of any State Party for more than five years after the date on which the request of a State Party under section 2602(a) of this title is made to the United States. This period may be extended by the President for three more years if the President determines that the emergency condition continues to apply with respect to the archaeological or ethnological material. However, before taking such action, the President shall request and consider, if received within ninety days, a report of the Committee setting forth its recommendations, together with the reasons therefor, as to whether such import restrictions shall be extended.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The import restrictions under this section may continue to apply in whole or in part, if before their expiration under paragraph (3), there has entered into force with respect to the archaeological or ethnological materials an agreement under section 2602 of this title or an agreement with a State Party to which the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification. Such import restrictions may continue to apply for the duration of the agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">After any agreement enters into force under section 2602 of this title, or emergency action is taken under section 2603 of this title, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall by regulation promulgate (and when appropriate shall revise) a list of the archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party covered by the agreement or by such action. The Secretary may list such material by type or other appropriate classification, but each listing made under this section shall be sufficiently specific and precise to insure that (1) the import restrictions under section 2606 of this title are applied only to the archeological and ethnological material covered by the agreement or emergency action; and (2) fair notice is given to importers and other persons as to what material is subject to such restrictions.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2801 &#183; Congressional findings and purposes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is a substantial imbalance in international wine trade resulting, in part, from the relative accessibility enjoyed by foreign wines to the United States market while the United States wine industry faces restrictive tariff and nontariff barriers in virtually every existing or potential foreign market;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the restricted access to foreign markets and the continued low prices for United States wine and grape products adversely affect the economic position of our Nation's winemakers and grape growers, as well as all other domestic sectors that depend upon wine production;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the competitive position of United States wine in international trade has been weakened by foreign trade practices, high domestic interest rates, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) wine consumption per capita is very low in many major non-wine producing markets and the demand potential for United States wine is significant; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the United States winemaking industry has the capacity and the ability to export substantial volumes of wine and an increase in United States wine exports will create new jobs, improve this Nation's balance of trade, and otherwise strengthen the national economy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purposes of this chapter are&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide wine consumers with the greatest possible choice of wines from wine-producing countries;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the initiation of an export promotion program to develop, maintain, and expand foreign markets for United States wine; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to achieve greater access to foreign markets for United States wine and grape products through the reduction or elimination of tariff barriers and nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in wine.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;3101 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rapid growth in the world market for telecommunications products and services is likely to continue for several decades;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the United States can improve prospects for&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the growth of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) United States exports of telecommunications products and services, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) export-related employment and consumer services in the United States, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the continuance of the technological leadership of the United States,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by undertaking a program to achieve an open world market for trade in telecommunications products, services, and investment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) most foreign markets for telecommunications products, services, and investment are characterized by extensive government intervention (including restrictive import practices and discriminatory procurement practices) which adversely affect United States exports of telecommunications products and services and United States investment in telecommunications;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the open nature of the United States telecommunications market, accruing from the liberalization and restructuring of such market, has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to an increase in imports of telecommunications products and a growing imbalance in competitive opportunities for trade in telecommunications;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) unless this imbalance is corrected through the achievement of mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade in telecommunications products and services between the United States and foreign countries, the United States should avoid granting continued open access to the telecommunications products and services of such foreign countries in the United States market; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the unique business conditions in the worldwide market for telecommunications products and services caused by the combination of deregulation and divestiture in the United States, which represents a unilateral liberalization of United States trade with the rest of the world, and continuing government intervention in the domestic industries of many other countries create a need to make an exception in the case of telecommunications products and services that should not necessarily be a precedent for legislating specific sectoral priorities in combating the closed markets or unfair foreign trade practices of other countries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster the economic and technological growth of, and employment in, the United States telecommunications industry;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to secure a high quality telecommunications network for the benefit of the people of the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop an international consensus in favor of open trade and competition in telecommunications products and services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to ensure that countries which have made commitments to open telecommunications trade fully abide by those commitments; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to achieve a more open world trading system for telecommunications products and services through negotiation and provision of mutually advantageous market opportunities for United States telecommunications exporters and their subsidiaries in those markets in which barriers exist to free international trade.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The elimination of Mexico's restrictive barriers to trade in motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts over a 10-year period under the Agreement should increase substantially United States exports of such products to Mexico.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Department of Commerce estimates that the Agreement provides the opportunity to increase United States exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts by $1,000,000,000 during the first year of the Agreement's implementation with the potential for additional increases over the 10-year transition period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States automotive industry has estimated that United States exports of motor vehicles to Mexico should increase to more than 60,000 units during the first year of the Agreement's implementation, which is substantially above the current level of 4,000 units.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No later than July 1, 1995, and annually thereafter through 1999, the Trade Representative shall submit a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on how effective the provisions of the Agreement are with respect to increasing United States exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts to Mexico.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region richly endowed with both natural and human resources;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous economic potential and of enduring political significance to the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the region has experienced the strengthening of democracy as countries in sub-Saharan Africa have taken steps to encourage broader participation in the political process;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa have increased their economic growth rates, taken significant steps towards liberalizing their economies, and made progress toward regional economic integration that can have positive benefits for the region;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa averages approximately $500 annually;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) trade and investment, as the American experience has shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic development and for encouraging broader participation in a political process in which political freedom can flourish;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest impact in an economic environment in which trading partners eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage the development of a vibrant private sector that offers individual African citizens the freedom to expand their economic opportunities and provide for their families;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of the positive economic and political developments under way throughout the region; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of trade and investment for the region as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h3 class="subchapter-head">Subchapter III&#8212;Economic Development Related Issues</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;3731 &#183; Sense of the Congress regarding comprehensive debt relief for the world's poorest countries</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many of the world's poorest countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Until recently, the United States Government and other official creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt reduction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their capacity to repay.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the international community that all multilateral and bilateral creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to address concerns raised about country conditionality, the amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation in the world's poorest countries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of the Congress</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Congress and the President should work together, without undue delay and in concert with the international community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and poverty alleviation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) this program of debt relief should also support the adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits are shared widely among the population, such as through initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken into account;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict or spends excessively on its military; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing assistance to the governments of sub-Saharan African countries to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) liberalize trade and promote exports;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) make financial and fiscal reforms; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) promote greater agribusiness linkages;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) addressing such critical agricultural policy issues as market liberalization, agricultural export development, and agribusiness investment in processing and transporting agricultural commodities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increasing the number of reverse trade missions to growth-oriented countries in sub-Saharan Africa;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) increasing trade in services; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) encouraging greater sub-Saharan African participation in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization on services and making further commitments in their schedules to the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to encourage the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee (SAAC) is to be commended for aiding the Bank in advancing the economic partnership between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa by doubling the number of sub-Saharan African countries in which the Bank is open for traditional financing and by increasing by tenfold the Bank's support for sales to sub-Saharan Africa from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999.

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;3735 &#183; Expansion of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (hereafter in this section referred to as the "Commercial Service") plays an important role in helping United States businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals providing services in eight countries. By early 1997, that presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established posts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater United States export activity in those markets, and similar encouragement should be provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage the export of United States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration shall make a special effort to&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) hold discussions with appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan Africa on the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for United States exporters of goods and services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or personnel to that region; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years after May 18, 2000.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use of sustainable development assistance to support further economic growth</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon the development of a receptive environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve this objective the United States Agency for International Development should continue to support programs which help to create this environment. Investments in human resources, development, and implementation of free market policies, including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and improve food security, and the support for the rule of law and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declarations of policy</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following declarations:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Development Fund for Africa established under chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293 et seq.) has been an effective tool in providing development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa since 1988.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Development Fund for Africa will complement the other provisions of this chapter and lay a foundation for increased trade and investment opportunities between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Assistance provided through the Development Fund for Africa will continue to support programs and activities that promote the long term economic development of sub-Saharan Africa, such as programs and activities relating to the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Strengthening primary and vocational education systems, especially the acquisition of middle-level technical skills for operating modern private businesses and the introduction of college level business education, including the study of international business, finance, and stock exchanges.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Strengthening health care systems.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Supporting democratization, good governance and civil society and conflict resolution efforts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Increasing food security by promoting the expansion of agricultural and agriculture-based industrial production and productivity and increasing real incomes for poor individuals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Promoting an enabling environment for private sector-led growth through sustained economic reform, privatization programs, and market-led economic activities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Promoting decentralization and local participation in the development process, especially linking the rural production sectors and the industrial and market centers throughout Africa.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Increasing the technical and managerial capacity of sub-Saharan African individuals to manage the economy of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Ensuring sustainable economic growth through environmental protection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The African Development Foundation has a unique congressional mandate to empower the poor to participate fully in development and to increase opportunities for gainful employment, poverty alleviation, and more equitable income distribution in sub-Saharan Africa. The African Development Foundation has worked successfully to enhance the role of women as agents of change, strengthen the informal sector with an emphasis on supporting micro and small sized enterprises, indigenous technologies, and mobilizing local financing. The African Development Foundation should develop and implement strategies for promoting participation in the socioeconomic development process of grassroots and informal sector groups such as nongovernmental organizations, cooperatives, artisans, and traders into the programs and initiatives established under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Sustained economic development in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon successful trade with and foreign assistance to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) The HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the future of the workforce in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Studies show that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa most severely affects individuals between the ages of 15 and 49&#8212;the age group that provides the most support for the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Clear evidence demonstrates that HIV/AIDS is destructive to the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Sustained economic development is critical to creating the public and private sector resources in sub-Saharan Africa necessary to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa should be a central component of United States foreign policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) significant progress needs to be made in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in order to sustain a mutually beneficial trade relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the national security of the United States. Trade is critical to the economic growth and strength of the United States and to its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold War, binding nations together through a series of mutual rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and peace throughout the world.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The national security of the United States depends on its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of the economy of the United States, such as information technology, telecommunications and other leading technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, and intellectual property. Trade will create new opportunities for the United States and preserve the unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, political, and military affairs. The United States, secured by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that dispute settlement procedures under international trade agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in such agreements. Therefore&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the recent pattern of decisions by dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body to impose obligations and restrictions on the use of antidumping, countervailing, and safeguard measures by WTO members under the Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards has raised concerns; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Congress is concerned that dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body appropriately apply the standard of review contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO member of provisions of that Agreement, and to the evaluation by a WTO member of the facts where that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the establishment of the facts is proper.</p>

<h3 class="chapter-head">Chapter 25. Clean Diamond Trade</h3>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;3901 &#183; Findings</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being used by rebels and state actors to finance military activities, overthrow legitimate governments, subvert international efforts to promote peace and stability, and commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. During the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been driven from their homes by wars waged in large part for control of diamond mining areas. A million of these are refugees eking out a miserable existence in neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have fled to the United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have died during these wars.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights violations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Human rights and humanitarian advocates, the diamond trade as represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United States Government have been working to block the trade in conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in conflict diamonds.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to address threats to international peace and security posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these actions, it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons to certain countries affected by such conflicts. It has further required all states to prohibit the direct and indirect import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone unless the diamonds are controlled under specified certificate of origin regimes and to prohibit absolutely the direct and indirect import of rough diamonds from Liberia.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified certificates of origin and fully prohibiting the importation of rough diamonds from Liberia. The United States is now taking further action against trade in conflict diamonds.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat of a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other countries are involved in working, through the "Kimberley Process", toward devising a solution to this problem. As the consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the United States has an obligation to help sever the link between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an effective solution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the trade in conflict diamonds.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Interlaken Declaration on the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds of November 5, 2002, states that Participants will ensure that measures taken to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds will be consistent with international trade rules.</p>
