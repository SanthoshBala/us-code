<h3 class="section-head">&#167;106 &#183; Basis for settlement of termination claims</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Priority to private contractors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Government, and it shall be the responsibility of the contracting agencies and the Administrator of General Services to provide war contractors with speedy and fair compensation for the termination of any war contract, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter, giving priority to contractors whose facilities are privately owned or privately operated. Such fair compensation for the termination of subcontracts shall be based on the same principles as compensation for the termination of prime contracts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of methods and standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each contracting agency shall establish methods and standards, suitable to the conditions of various war contractors, for determining fair compensation for the termination of war contracts on the basis of actual, standard, average, or estimated costs, or of a percentage of the contract price based on the estimated percentage of completion of work under the terminated contract, or on any other equitable basis, as it deems appropriate. To the extent that such methods and standards require accounting, they shall be adapted, so far as practicable, to the accounting systems used by war contractors, if consistent with recognized commercial accounting practice.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conclusiveness of settlement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may settle all or any part of any termination claim under any war contract by agreement with the war contractor, or by determination of the amount due on the claim or part thereof without such agreement, or by any combination of these methods. Where any such settlement is made by agreement, the settlement shall be final and conclusive, except (1) to the extent otherwise agreed in the settlement; (2) for fraud; (3) upon renegotiation to eliminate excessive profits under section 1191 of Appendix to title 50, unless exempt or exempted under such section; or (4) by mutual agreement before or after payment. Where any such settlement is made by determination without agreement, it shall likewise be final and conclusive, subject to the same exceptions as if made by agreement, unless the war contractor appeals or brings suit in accordance with section 113 of this title: Provided, That no settlement agreement hereunder involving payment to a war contractor of an amount in excess of $50,000 (or such lesser amount as the Administrator of General Services may from time to time determine) shall become binding upon the Government until the agreement has been reviewed and approved by a settlement review board of three or more members established by the contracting agency in the bureau, division, regional or district office, or other unit of the contracting agency authorized to make such settlement, or in the event of disapproval by the settlement review board, unless approved by the head of such bureau, division, regional or district office, or other unit. Failure of the settlement review board to act upon any settlement within thirty days after its submission to the board shall operate as approval by the board. The sole function of settlement review boards shall be to determine the over-all reasonableness of proposed settlement agreements from the point of view of protecting the interests of the Government. In determining, for purposes of this subsection, whether review of any settlement agreement is required because of the amounts involved, no deduction shall be made on account of credits for property chargeable to the Government or for advance or partial payments, but amounts payable under such settlement agreement for completed articles or work at the contract price and for the discharge of the termination claims of subcontractors shall be deducted.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allowable costs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as hereinafter provided, the methods and standards established under subsection (b) of this section for determining fair compensation for termination claims which are not settled by agreement shall be designed to compensate the war contractor fairly for the termination of the war contract, taking into account&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the direct and indirect manufacturing, selling and distribution, administrative and other costs and expenses incurred by the war contractor which are reasonably necessary for the performance of the war contract and properly allocable to the terminated portion thereof under recognized commercial accounting practices; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reasonable costs and expenses of settling termination claims of subcontractors related to the terminated portion of the war contract; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reasonable accounting, legal, clerical, and other costs and expenses incident to termination and settlement of the terminated war contract; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) reasonable costs and expenses of removing, preserving, storing and disposing of termination inventories; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such allowance for profit on the preparations made and work done for the terminated portion of the war contract as is reasonable under the circumstances; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) interest on the termination claim in accordance with subsection (f) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the contract price and all amounts otherwise paid or payable under the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The following shall not be included as elements of cost:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Losses on other contracts, or from sales or exchanges of capital assets, fees and other expenses in connection with reorganization or recapitalization, antitrust or Federal income-tax litigation, or prosecution of Federal income-tax claims or other claims against the Government (except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection); losses on investments; provisions for contingencies; and premiums on life insurance where the contractor is the beneficiary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The expense of conversion of the contractor's facilities to uses other than the performance of the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Expenses due to the negligence or willful failure of the contractor to discontinue with reasonable promptness the incurring of expenses after the effective date of the termination notice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Costs incurred in respect to facilities, materials, or services purchased or work done in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirements of the entire contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The failure specifically to mention in this subsection any item of cost is not intended to imply that it should be allowed or disallowed. The Administrator of General Services may interpret the provisions of this subsection and may provide for the inclusion or exclusion of other costs in accordance with recognized commercial accounting practice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Where the small size of claims or the nature of production or performance or other factors make it impracticable to apply the principles stated in this subsection to any class of settlements which are subject to this subsection, the contracting agencies may establish alternative methods and standards for determining fair compensation for that class of termination claims. The aggregate amount of compensation allowed in accordance with this subsection (excluding amounts allowed under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection) shall not exceed the total contract price reduced by the amount of payments otherwise made or to be made under the contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Settlement by agreement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the objectives of this chapter, termination claims shall be settled by agreement to the maximum extent feasible and the methods and standards established under subsection (b) of this section shall be designed to facilitate such settlements. To the extent that he deems it practicable to do so without impeding expeditious settlements, the Administrator of General Services shall require the contracting agencies to take into account the factors enumerated in subsection (d) of this section in establishing methods and standards for determining fair compensation in the settlement of termination claims by agreement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each contracting agency shall allow and pay interest on the amount due and unpaid from time to time on any termination claim under a prime contract at the rate of 21/2 per centum per annum for the period beginning thirty days after the date fixed for termination and ending with the date of final payment, except that (1) if the prime contractor unreasonably delays the settlement of his claim, interest shall not accrue for the period of such delay, (2) if interest for the period after termination on any advance payment or loan, made or guaranteed by the Government, has been waived for the benefit of the contractor, the amount of the interest so waived allocable to the terminated contract or the terminated part of the contract shall be deducted from the interest otherwise payable hereunder, and (3) if after delivery of findings by a contracting agency, the contractor appeals or sues as provided in section 113 of this title, interest shall not accrue after the thirtieth day following the delivery of the findings on any amount allowed by such findings, unless such amount is increased upon such appeal or suit. In approving, ratifying, authorizing, or making termination settlements with subcontractors, each contracting agency shall allow interest on the termination claim of the subcontractor on the same basis and subject to the same conditions as are applicable to a prime contractor.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Amendment of contracts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Where any war contract does not provide for or provides against such fair compensation for its termination, the contracting agency, either before or after its termination, shall amend such war contract by agreement with the war contractor, or shall authorize, approve, or ratify an amendment of such war contract by the parties thereto, to provide for such fair compensation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;107 &#183; Settlement of subcontractors&#8217; claims</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conclusiveness of settlement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Where, in connection with the settlement of any termination claim by a contracting agency, any war contractor makes settlements of the termination claims of his subcontractors, the contracting agency shall limit or omit its review of such settlements with subcontractors to the maximum extent compatible with the public interest. Any contracting agency (1) may approve, ratify, or authorize such settlements with subcontractors upon such evidence, terms, and conditions as it deems proper; (2) shall vary the scope and intensity of its review of such settlements according to the reliability of the war contractor, the size, number, and complexity of such claims, and other relevant factors; and (3) shall authorize war contractors to make such settlements with subcontractors without review by the contracting agency, whenever the reliability of the war contractor, the amount or nature of the claims, or other reasons appear to the contracting agency to justify such action. Any such settlement of a subcontract approved, ratified, or authorized by a contracting agency shall be final and conclusive as to the amount due to the same extent as a settlement under subsection (c) of section 106 of this title, and no war contractor shall be liable to the United States on account of any amounts paid thereon except for his own fraud.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supervision of payments to war contractors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any contracting agency is satisfied of the inability of a war contractor to meet his obligations it shall exercise supervision or control over payments to the war contractor on account of termination claims of subcontractors of such war contractor to such extent and in such manner as it deems necessary or desirable for the purpose of assuring the receipt of the benefit of such payments by the subcontractors.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Group settlements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe policies and methods for the settlement as a group, or otherwise, by any contracting agency of some or all of the termination claims of a war contractor under war contracts with one or more (1) bureaus or divisions within a contracting agency, (2) contracting agencies, or (3) prime contractors and subcontractors, to the extent he deems such action necessary or desirable for expeditious and equitable settlement of such claims. After consulting with the contracting agencies concerned, the Administrator of General Services may provide for assigning any war contractor to a contracting agency for such settlement, and such agency shall have authority to settle, on behalf of any other contracting agency, some or all of the termination claims of such war contractor.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Direct settlement by contracting agency</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may settle directly termination claims of subcontractors to the extent that it deems such action necessary or desirable for the expeditious and equitable settlement of such claims. In making such termination settlements any contracting agency may discharge the claim of the subcontractor by payment or may purchase such claim, and may agree to assume, or indemnify the subcontractor against, any claims by any person in connection with such claim or the termination settlement. Any contracting agency undertaking to settle the termination claim of any subcontractor shall deliver to the subcontractor and the war contractor liable to him written notice stating its acceptance of responsibility for settling his claim and the conditions applicable thereto, which may include the release, or assignment to the contracting agency, of his claim against the war contractor liable to him; upon consent thereto by the subcontractor, the Government shall become liable for the settlement of his claims upon the conditions specified in the notice.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prime contractors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Government, and it shall be the responsibility of the contracting agencies and the Administrator of General Services, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter, to provide war contractors having any termination claim or claims, pending their settlement, with adequate interim financing, within thirty days after proper application therefor.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of financing; amounts payable</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each contracting agency shall, to the greatest extent it deems practicable, make available interim financing through loans and discounts, and commitments and guaranties in connection therewith, in contemplation of or related to termination of war contracts. Where interim financing is made by advance payments or partial payments, it shall, insofar as practicable, consist of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An amount equal to 100 per centum of the amount payable, at the contract price, on account of acceptable items completed prior to the termination date under the terms of the contract, or completed thereafter with the approval of the contracting agency; plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An amount equal to 90 per centum of the cost of raw materials, purchased parts, supplies, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead allocable to the terminated portion of the war contract; plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A reasonable percentage of other allowable costs, including administrative overhead, allocable to the terminated portion of the war contract not included in the foregoing; plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Such additional amounts, if any, as the contracting agency deems necessary to provide the war contractor with adequate interim financing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In lieu of the costs referred to in clauses (2) and (3) of this subsection, where a detailed ascertainment of such costs is not suitable to the conditions of any war contractor and is apt to cause delay in the obtaining of interim financing by him, that portion of such interim financing shall be equal to an amount not greater than 90 per centum of the estimated costs which are allocable to the terminated part or parts of the war contract or group of war contracts, and are ascertained in accordance with such methods and standards as the Administrator of General Services shall prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) There shall be deducted from the amount of such interim financing any unliquidated balances of advance and partial payments theretofore made to such war contractor, which are allocable to the terminated war contract or the terminated part of the war contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Evidence to support financing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe (1) the types of estimates, certificates, or other evidence to be required to support such interim financing; (2) the terms and conditions upon which such interim financing shall be made including the use of standard forms for agreements with respect to such interim financing to the extent practicable; (3) the classes of cases in which such interim financing shall be refused; and (4) such methods of supervision and control over such interim financing as he deems necessary or desirable to assure adequate and speedy interim financing to subcontractors of the war contractor.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Penalty for overstatement of claims</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In case of an overstatement by any war contractor of the amount due on his termination claim or claims in connection with any interim financing under this chapter, such contractor shall pay to the United States, as a penalty, an amount equal to 6 per centum of the amount of the overstatement, but the Administrator of General Services may suspend or modify any such penalty if in his opinion the imposition thereof would be inequitable. Any penalty may be deducted from any amounts due the war contractor upon such termination claim or claims, or otherwise, or may be collected from the war contractor by suit. The obligation to pay any penalty imposed and to repay any interim financing made or assumed by the United States under this chapter shall constitute a debt due to the United States within the meaning of section 3713(a) of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Advance payments as part of termination settlement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may allow any advance payments, previously made or authorized by it in connection with the performance of a war contract, to be used for payments and expenses related to the termination settlement of such contract, upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate to protect the interest of the Government.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Liquidation of loans, etc., prior to final settlement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">No interim financing shall be made by any contracting agency under this chapter unless the terms of such financing provide for the liquidation by the war contractor of all loans, discounts, advance payments, or partial payments thereunder not later than the time of final payment of the amount due on the settlement of the termination claim or claims of the war contractor involved or such time thereafter as the contracting agency deems necessary for the liquidation of such interim financing in an orderly manner.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Settlement of claims; validation of prior financing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may settle, upon such terms and conditions as it deems proper, any claim or obligation due by or to the Government arising from or related to any interim financing made, acquired, or authorized by it. Any interim financing made, acquired, or authorized by any contracting agency before July 21, 1944, shall be valid to the extent it would be authorized under the provisions of this chapter if made after its effective date.</p>

Where the advance or partial payment was made by a war contractor and authorized, approved, or ratified by any contracting agency, the war contractor making it shall not be liable for any such excess payment in the absence of fraud on his part and shall receive payment or credit from the Government for the amount of such excess payment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Government, upon the termination of any war contract, to assure the expeditious removal from the plant of the war contractor of the termination inventory not to be retained or sold by the war contractor.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement on material of inventory</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any war contractor may submit to the contracting agency concerned or to any other Government agency designated by the Administrator of General Services, one or more statements showing the materials which such war contractor claims to be termination inventory under one or more war contracts and desires to have removed by the Government. Such statements shall be prepared in such form and detail, shall be submitted in such manner, through the prime contractor or otherwise, and shall be supported by such certificates or other data, as may be prescribed under this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Removal and storage by Government agency</h4>

If any war contractor intends so to remove any claimed termination inventory, he shall deliver to the Government agency concerned written notice of the date fixed for removal and a statement showing the quantities and condition of the materials so to be removed, certified on behalf of the war contractor to have been prepared in accordance with a concurrent physical inventory of such materials. Such notice and statement shall be delivered at least twenty days in advance of the date fixed for removal and may be delivered before or after the expiration of the period specified under subsection (c) of this section. If the Government agency fails to check such materials, at or before the time of their removal by the war contractor, a certificate of the war contractor specifying the materials shown on such statement which were so removed, and filed with the Government agency concerned within thirty days after the date fixed for removal, shall constitute prima facie evidence against the United States as to the quantities and condition of the materials so removed, and the fact of their removal.</p>

With respect to any such materials, the Government shall be liable to any war contractor concerned only for their return to such war contractor or for their disposal value at the time of their removal or for the proceeds realized by the Government from their disposal, at the election of the Government agency concerned, unless the Government agency and the war contractor agree or have agreed on a different basis. Any amount so paid or payable to a war contractor for materials allocable to a terminated war contract shall be credited against the termination claim under such contract but shall not otherwise affect the amount due on the claim, unless the Government agency concerned and the war contractor agree or have agreed otherwise.

The Government agency concerned may waive or release on behalf of the United States any obligation of the war contractor with respect to such machinery, tools, or equipment upon such terms and conditions as the agency deems appropriate. Upon the failure of the Government so to remove or provide for removal of any such machinery, tools, or equipment, the war contractor, subject to regulations prescribed under this chapter, may remove all or part of such machinery, tools, or equipment from his plant and may store it on his own premises or elsewhere, for the account and at the risk and expense of the Government, using reasonable care for its transportation and preservation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Failure to settle claims by agreement; preparation of findings; notice to war contractor</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the contracting agency responsible for settling any termination claim has not settled the claim by agreement or has so settled only a part of the claim, (1) the contracting agency at any time may determine the amount due on such claim or such unsettled part, and prepare written findings indicating the basis of the determination, and deliver a copy of such findings to the war contractor, or (2) if the termination claim has been submitted in the manner and substantially the form prescribed under this chapter, the contracting agency, upon written demand by the war contractor for such findings, shall determine the amount due on the claim or unsettled part and prepare and deliver such findings to the war contractor within ninety days after the receipt by the agency of such demand. In preparing such findings, the contracting agency may require the war contractor to furnish such information and to submit to such audits as may be reasonably necessary for that purpose. Within thirty days after the delivery of any such findings, the contracting agency shall pay to the war contractor at least 90 per centum of the amount thereby determined to be due, after deducting the amount of any outstanding interim financing applicable thereto.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rights of war contractor</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any war contractor is aggrieved by the findings of a contracting agency on his claim or part thereof or by its failure to make such findings in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, he may bring suit against the United States for such claim or such part thereof, in the United States Court of Federal Claims or in a United States district court, in accordance with sections 1346, 2401, and 2402 of title 28, except that, if the contracting agency is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, or any corporation organized pursuant to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, or any corporation owned or controlled by the United States, the suit shall be brought against such corporation in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with existing law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedure</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any proceeding under subsection (b) of this section shall be governed by the following conditions:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) When any contracting agency provides a procedure within the agency for protest against such findings or for other appeal therefrom by the war contractor, the war contractor, before proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, (i) in his discretion may resort to such procedure within the time specified in his contract or, if no time is specified, within thirty days after the delivery to him of the findings; and (ii) shall resort to such procedure for protest or other appeal to the extent required by the Administrator of General Services, but failure of the contracting agency to act on any such required protest or appeal within thirty days shall operate as a refusal by the agency to modify its findings. Any revision of the findings by the contracting agency, upon protest or appeal within the agency, shall be treated as the findings of the agency for the purpose of appeal or suit under subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract, no war contractor shall be required to protest or appeal from such findings within the contracting agency except in accordance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A war contractor may initiate proceedings in accordance with subsection (b) of this section (i) within ninety days after delivery to him of the findings by the contracting agency, or (ii) in case of protests or appeal within the agency, within ninety days after the determination of such protest or appeal, or (iii) in case of failure to deliver such findings, within one year after his demand therefor. If he does not initiate such proceedings within the time specified, he shall be precluded thereafter from initiating any proceedings in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the findings of the contracting agency shall be final and conclusive, or if no findings were made, he shall be deemed to have waived such termination claim.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract, the court shall not be bound by the findings of the contracting agency, but shall treat such findings as prima facie correct, and the burden shall be on the war contractor to establish that the amount due on his claim or part thereof exceeds the amount allowed by the findings of the contracting agency. Whenever the court finds that the war contractor failed to negotiate in good faith with the contracting agency for the settlement of his claim or part thereof before appeal or suit thereon, or failed to furnish to the agency any information reasonably requested by it regarding his termination claim or part thereof, or failed to prosecute diligently any protest or appeal required to be taken under subsection (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the court (i) may refuse to receive in evidence any information not submitted to the contracting agency; (ii) may deny interest on the claim or part thereof for such period as it deems proper; or (iii) may remand the case to the contracting agency for further proceedings upon such terms as the court may prescribe. Unless the case is remanded, the court shall enter the appropriate award or judgment on the basis of the law and facts, and may increase or decrease the amount allowed by the findings of the contracting agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any such proceedings shall not affect the authority of the contracting agency concerned to make a settlement of the termination claim, or any part thereof, by agreement with the war contractor at any time before such proceedings are concluded.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Omitted</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Arbitration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The contracting agency responsible for settling any claim and the war contractor asserting the claim, by agreement, may submit all or any part of the termination claim to arbitration, without regard to the amount in dispute. Such arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of United States Arbitration Act to the same extent as if authorized by an effective agreement in writing between the Government and the war contractor. Any such arbitration award shall be final and conclusive upon the United States to the same extent as a settlement under subsection (c) of section 106 of this title, but shall not be subject to approval by any settlement review board.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Conclusiveness of decisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any dispute exists between any war contractor and a subcontractor regarding any termination claim, either of them, by agreement with the other, may submit the dispute to a contracting agency for mediation or arbitration whenever authorized by the agency or required by the Administrator of General Services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any award or decision in such proceedings shall be final and conclusive as to the parties so submitting any such dispute and shall not be questioned by the United States in settling any related claim, in the absence of fraud or collusion.</p>

If the name and address of any such person is known or can be ascertained by reasonable diligence, and if he resides within the jurisdiction of the United States, he shall be summoned to appear by personal service; but if any such person resides outside of the jurisdiction of the United States, or is unknown, or if for any other good and sufficient reason appearing to the court personal service cannot be had, he may be summoned by publication, under such rules as the court may adopt, together with a copy of the summons mailed by registered mail to such person's last known address. The United States Court of Federal Claims may, upon motion of the Attorney General, in any suit or proceeding where there may be any number of persons having possible interests therein, notify such persons to appear to assert and defend such interests. Upon failure so to appear, any and all claims or interests in claims of any such person against the United States, in respect of the subject matter of such suit or proceeding, shall forever be barred and the court shall have jurisdiction to enter judgment pro confesso upon any claim or contingent claim asserted on behalf of the United States against any person who, having been duly served with summons, fails to respond thereto, to the same extent and with like effect as if such person had appeared and had admitted the truth of all allegations made on behalf of the United States. Upon appearance by any person pursuant to any such summons or notice, the case as to such person shall, for all purposes, be treated as if an independent proceeding has been instituted by such person pursuant to sections 1491, 1496, 1501, 1503, and 2501 of title 28, and as if such independent proceeding had then been consolidated, for purposes of trial and determination, with the case in respect of which the summons or notice was issued, except that the United States shall not be heard upon any counterclaims, claims for damages or other demands whatsoever against such person, other than claims and contingent claims for the recovery of money hereafter paid by the United States in respect of the transaction or matter which constitutes the subject matter of such case, unless and until such person shall assert therein a claim, or an interest in a claim, against the United States, and the United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate, as between any and all adverse claimants, their respective several interests in any matter in suit and to award several judgments in accordance therewith.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;253 &#183; Competition requirements</h3>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procurement through full and open competition; competitive procedures</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (g) of this section and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by statute, an executive agency in conducting a procurement for property or services&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the competitive procedures appropriate under the circumstance, an executive agency&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall solicit sealed bids if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under clause (A).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of particular source; restriction of solicitation to small business concerns</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain any alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the agency head determines that to do so&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of such property or services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures, but excluding other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 638 and 644 of title 15.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of noncompetitive procedures</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center, or (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States Government and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (h)&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the disclosure of the executive agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the head of the executive agency&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Property or services deemed available from only one source; nondelegable authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purposes of applying subsection (c)(1) of this section&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services shall be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept the substance of which is not otherwise available to the United States and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in (i) substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the executive agency's needs, such property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the head of an executive agency under subsection (c)(7) of this section may not be delegated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Offer requests to potential sources</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of subsection (c)(2) or (c)(6) of this section shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Justification for use of noncompetitive procedures</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an executive agency may not award a contract using procedures other than competitive procedures unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the contracting officer for the contract justifies the use of such procedures in writing and certifies the accuracy and completeness of the justification;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the justification is approved&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $500,000 (but equal to or less than $10,000,000), by the competition advocate for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $10,000,000 (but equal to or less than $50,000,000), by the head of the procuring activity or a delegate who, if a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer or, if a civilian, is serving in a position in grade GS&#8211;16 or above under the General Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $50,000,000, by the senior procurement executive of the agency designated pursuant to section 414(3)&#160;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any required notice has been published with respect to such contract pursuant to section 416 of this title and all bids or proposals received in response to such notice have been considered by such executive agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(2), the justification and approval required by paragraph (1) may be made after the contract is awarded. The justification and approval required by paragraph (1) is not required&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when a statute expressly requires that the procurement be made from a specified source;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(7) of this section; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a procurement conducted under (i) the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46 et seq.), or (ii) section 637(a) of title 15.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The justification required by paragraph (1)(A) shall include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description of the agency's needs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an identification of the statutory exception from the requirement to use competitive procedures and a demonstration, based on the proposed contractor's qualifications or the nature of the procurement, of the reasons for using that exception;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a determination that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a description of the market survey conducted or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the procurement; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) a statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome a barrier to competition before a subsequent procurement for such needs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The justification required by paragraph (1)(A) and any related information shall be made available for inspection by the public consistent with the provisions of section 552 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) In no case may an executive agency&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enter into a contract for property or services using procedures other than competitive procedures on the basis of the lack of advance planning or concerns related to the amount of funds available to the agency for procurement functions; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) procure property or services from another executive agency unless such other executive agency complies fully with the requirements of this subchapter in its procurement of such property or services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The restriction set out in clause (B) is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other restriction provided by law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Simplified procedures for small purchases</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to promote efficiency and economy in contracting and to avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors, the Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the property or services sought and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe regulations that provide special simplified procedures for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property at rental rates that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the rental rate or rates under a multiyear lease do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold if the average annual amount of the rent payable for the period of the lease does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the simplified procedures required by paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In using the simplified procedures, an executive agency shall promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) An executive agency shall comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions referred to in section 427(f) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Merit-based award of contracts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is the policy of Congress that an executive agency should not be required by legislation to award a new contract to a specific non-Federal Government entity. It is further the policy of Congress that any program, project, or technology identified in legislation be procured through merit-based selection procedures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A provision of law may not be construed as requiring a new contract to be awarded to a specified non-Federal Government entity unless that provision of law&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specifically refers to this subsection;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) specifically identifies the particular non-Federal Government entity involved; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specifically states that the award to that entity is required by such provision of law in contravention of the policy set forth in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, a contract is a new contract unless the work provided for in the contract is a continuation of the work performed by the specified entity under a preceding contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection shall not apply with respect to any contract that calls upon the National Academy of Sciences to investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an executive agency and to report on such matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the executive agency and the market available to satisfy such needs. Subject to such needs, specifications may be stated in terms of&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) function, so that a variety of products or services may qualify;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) performance, including specifications of the range of acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable standards; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the time and place for submission of proposals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) significantly less important than cost or price.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations implementing subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) may not define the terms &#8220;significantly more important&#8221; and &#8220;significantly less important&#8221; as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &#8220;Qualification requirement&#8221; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In this section, &#8220;qualification requirement&#8221; means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agency head; functions; prior to enforcement of qualification requirement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the head of the agency shall, before enforcing any qualification requirement&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror upon request all requirements which a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy in order to become qualified, such requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specify an estimate of the costs of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror in order to become qualified;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, upon request, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate at its own expense (except as provided in subsection (d) of this section) its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned or of another agency obtained through interagency agreement, or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of clause (4), provide to the extent possible that such services be provided by a contractor who is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources and who shall be required in such contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event qualification is not attained, is promptly furnished specific information why qualification was not attained.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicability; waiver authority; referral of offers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement. After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (b) of this section for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The waiver authority contained in paragraph (2) shall not apply with respect to any qualified products list.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement, if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 637(b)(7) of title 15 if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) of this section or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the agency determines that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements) the costs incurred by the agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 632 of title 15.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Examination; need for qualification requirement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification requirement, the need for such qualification requirement shall be examined and the standards of such requirement revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enforcement determination by agency head</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>

If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Decision; validity of asserted restriction; failure to submit response</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the award of a follow-on contract has been delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extension is necessary in order to ensure continuity of the receipt of services pending the award of, and commencement of performance under, the follow-on contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A task order contract may be extended under the authority of paragraph (1) only once and only in accordance with the limitations and requirements of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Inapplicability to certain contracts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to a contract for the acquisition of property or services that includes acquisition of advisory and assistance services if the head of the executive agency entering into such contract determines that, under the contract, advisory and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a significant component of, the contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &#8220;Advisory and assistance services&#8221; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &#8220;advisory and assistance services&#8221; has the meaning given such term in section 1105(g) of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Multiple award contracts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">When multiple contracts are awarded under section 253h(d)(1)(B) or 253i(e) of this title, all contractors awarded such contracts shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered, pursuant to procedures set forth in the contracts, for each task or delivery order in excess of $2,500 that is to be issued under any of the contracts unless&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the executive agency's need for the services or property ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing such opportunity to all such contractors would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling that need;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) only one such contractor is capable of providing the services or property required at the level of quality required because the services or property ordered are unique or highly specialized;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is necessary to place the order with a particular contractor in order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statement of work</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Protests</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Task and delivery order ombudsman</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The head of each executive agency who awards multiple task or delivery order contracts pursuant to section 253h(d)(1)(B) or 253i(e) of this title shall appoint or designate a task and delivery order ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors on such contracts and ensuring that all of the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task or delivery orders when required under subsection (b) of this section. The task and delivery order ombudsman shall be a senior agency official who is independent of the contracting officer for the contracts and may be the executive agency's competition advocate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40 is used or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) of this section that the procedures are appropriate for use.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria for use</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when the contracting officer anticipates that three or more offers will be received for such contract, design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for such contract, the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer, and the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The time constraints for delivery of the project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Other criteria established by the agency.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures described</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals which meet the Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include information on the offeror's&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) technical approach; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical qualifications; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not include&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) detailed design information; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) cost or price information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team) and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work (or both), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 253a of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The agency awards the contract in accordance with section 253b of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Solicitation to state number of offerors to be selected for phase-two requests for competitive proposals</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) of this section shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section. The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Requirement for guidance and regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) of this section are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, contracts awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures may be of any type which in the opinion of the agency head will promote the best interests of the Government. Every contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a suitable warranty, as determined by the agency head, by the contractor that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure such contract upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, excepting bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the contractor for the purpose of securing business, for the breach or violation of which warranty the Government shall have the right to annul such contract without liability or in its discretion to deduct from the contract price or consideration the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.

All cost and cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contracts shall provide for advance notification by the contractor to the procuring agency of any subcontract thereunder on a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee basis and of any fixed-price subcontract or purchase order which exceeds in dollar amount either the simplified acquisition threshold or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the prime contract; and a procuring agency, through any authorized representative thereof, shall have the right to inspect the plans and to audit the books and records of any prime contractor or subcontractor engaged in the performance of a cost or cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Cost or pricing data required to be submitted under paragraph (1) (or under subsection (c) of this section), and a certification required to be submitted under paragraph (2), shall be submitted&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) A waiver of requirements for submission of certified cost or pricing data that is granted under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section in the case of a contract or subcontract does not waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(C) for submission of cost or pricing data in the case of subcontracts under that contract or subcontract unless the head of the procuring activity granting the waiver determines that the requirement under that paragraph should be waived in the case of such subcontracts and justifies in writing the reasons for the determination.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for which the price agreed upon is based on&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) adequate price competition; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Modifications of contracts and subcontracts for commercial items</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a modification of a contract or subcontract for a commercial item that is not covered by the exception to the submission of certified cost or pricing data in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B), submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contract or subcontract being modified is a contract or subcontract for which submission of certified cost or pricing data may not be required by reason of paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the modification would not change the contract or subcontract, as the case may be, from a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a commercial item.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cost or pricing data on below-threshold contracts</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to require submission</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), when certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted by subsection (a) of this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, such data may nevertheless be required to be submitted by the head of the procuring activity, but only if the head of the procuring activity determines that such data are necessary for the evaluation by the agency of the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract. In any case in which the head of the procuring activity requires such data to be submitted under this subsection, the head of the procuring activity shall justify in writing the reason for such requirement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The head of the procuring activity may not require certified cost or pricing data to be submitted under this paragraph for any contract or subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, covered by the exceptions in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Delegation of authority prohibited</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The head of a procuring activity may not delegate the functions under this paragraph.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Submission of other information</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to require submission</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">When certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, the contracting officer shall require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract. Except in the case of a contract or subcontract covered by the exceptions in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the contracting officer shall require that the data submitted include, at a minimum, appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for the procurement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations on authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include the following provisions regarding the types of information that contracting officers may require under paragraph (1):</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Reasonable limitations on requests for sales data relating to commercial items.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A requirement that a contracting officer limit, to the maximum extent practicable, the scope of any request for information relating to commercial items from an offeror to only that information that is in the form regularly maintained by the offeror in commercial operations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A statement that any information received relating to commercial items that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5 shall not be disclosed by the Federal Government.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) of this section is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it shall be a defense that the United States did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section before such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable under paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest and penalties for certain overpayments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for interest on the amount of such overpayment, to be computed&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of title 26; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the submission of such defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any liability under this subsection of a contractor that submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the certification required by subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data shall not be affected by the refusal to submit such certification.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Right of United States to examine contractor records</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and currency of cost or pricing data required to be submitted by this section, an executive agency shall have the authority provided by section 254d(a)(2) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree to a contract price adjustment, with interest, for any increased costs paid to such contractor or subcontractor by the United States by reason of a change in the contractor's or subcontractor's cost accounting practices or by reason of a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable cost accounting standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the United States and a contractor or subcontractor fail to agree on a contract price adjustment, including whether the contractor or subcontractor has complied with the applicable cost accounting standards, the disagreement will constitute a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act [41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any contract price adjustment undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be made, where applicable, on relevant contracts between the United States and the contractor that are subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the United States from payment, in the aggregate, of increased costs (as defined by the Board). In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the increased cost (as defined by the Board) to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless the contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of the price negotiation and which it failed to disclose to the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The interest rate applicable to any contract price adjustment shall be the annual rate of interest established under section 6621 of title 26 for such period.

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Costs which are the subject of cost accounting standards promulgated under this section shall not be subject to regulations that are established by another executive agency that differ from such standards with respect to the measurement, assignment, and allocation of such costs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Examinations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of determining whether a contractor or subcontractor has complied with cost accounting standards promulgated under this section and has followed consistently the contractor's or subcontractor's disclosed cost accounting practices, any authorized representative of the head of the agency concerned, of the offices of inspector general established pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, or of the Comptroller General of the United States shall have the right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records of such contractor or subcontractor relating to compliance with such cost accounting standards.</p>
