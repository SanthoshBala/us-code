<h3 class="section-head">&#167;1a&#8211;1 &#183; National Park System: administration; declaration of findings and purpose</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares that the national park system, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States, its territories and island possessions; that these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their inter-related purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage; that, individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superb environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one national park system preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and that it is the purpose of this Act to include all such areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the system. Congress further reaffirms, declares, and directs that the promotion and regulation of the various areas of the National Park System, as defined in section 1c of this title, shall be consistent with and founded in the purpose established by section 1 of this title, to the common benefit of all the people of the United States. The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and administration of these areas shall be conducted in light of the high public value and integrity of the National Park System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Down tree personal property severed subsequent to December 31, 1974, and prior to February 1, 1978 may be removed in accordance with applicable State and Federal law, or other applicable licenses, permits, and existing agreements, unless the Secretary determines that the removal of such down timber would damage second growth resources or result in excessive sedimentation in Redwood Creek: Provided, however, That down timber lying in stream beds may not be removed without permission of the Secretary: Provided, That such removal shall also be subject to such reasonable conditions as may be required by the Secretary to insure the continued availability of raw materials to Redwoods United, Incorporated, a nonprofit corporation located in Manila, California.</p>

Such compensation shall be paid either: (A) by the Secretary of the Treasury from money appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, including money appropriated to the Fund pursuant to section 4(b) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, as amended [16 U.S.C. 460l&#8211;7(b)] subject to the appropriation limitation in section 79j of this title, upon certification to him by the Secretary of the agreed negotiated value of such property, or the valuation of the property awarded by judgment, including interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date of taking the property to the date of payment therefor; or (B) by the Secretary, if the owner of the land concurs, with any federally owned property available to him for purposes of exchange pursuant to the provisions of section 79e of this title; or (C) by the Secretary using any combination of such money or federally owned property. Any action against the United States with regard to the provisions of this subchapter and for the recovery of just compensation for the lands and interests therein taken by the United States, and for the down tree personal property taken, shall be brought in the United States district court for the district where the land is located without regard to the amount claimed. The United States may initiate proceedings at any time seeking a determination of just compensation in the district court in the manner provided by sections 1358 and 1403 of title 28 and may deposit in the registry of the court the estimated just compensation, or a part thereof, in accordance with the procedure generally described by section 3114(a)&#8211;(d) of title 40. Interest shall not be allowed on such amounts as shall have been paid into the court. In the event that the Secretary determines that the fee simple title to any property (real or personal) taken under this section is not necessary for the purposes of this subchapter, he may, with particular attention to minimizing the payment of severance damages and to allow for the orderly removal of down timber, revest title to such property subject to such reservations, terms, and conditions, if any, as he deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, and may compensate the former owner for no more than the fair market value of the rights so reserved, except that the Secretary may not revest title to any property for which just compensation has been paid; or, the Secretary may sell at fair market value without regard to the requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, such down timber as in his judgment may be removed without damage to the park, the proceeds from such sales being credited to the Treasury of the United States. If the State of California designates a right-of-way for a bypass highway around the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park prior to October 1, 1984, the Secretary is authorized and directed to acquire such lands or interests in lands as may be necessary for such a highway and, subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine are necessary to assure the adequate protection of Redwood National Park, shall thereupon donate the designated right-of-way to the State of California for a new bypass highway from a point south of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park through the drainage of May Creek and Boyes Creek to extend along the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park within Humboldt County. Such acreage as may be necessary in the judgment of the Secretary for this conveyance, and for a buffer thereof, shall be deemed to be a publicly owned highway for purposes of section 79b(a) of this title effective on March 27, 1978.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall apply to ownerships of fifty acres or less only if such ownerships are held or occupied primarily for nonresidential or nonagricultural purposes, and if the Secretary gives notice to the owner within sixty days after October 2, 1968, of the application of this subsection. Notice by the Secretary shall be deemed to have been made as of October 2, 1968. The district court of the United States for that district in which such ownerships are located shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action brought by any person having an interest therein for damages occurring by reason of the temporary application of this paragraph, between October 2, 1968, and the date upon which the Secretary gives such notice. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary under subsections (a) and (c) of this section to acquire such areas for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Minimization of severance damages; costs not chargeable against appropriations authorization</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If any individual tract or parcel of land acquired is partly inside and partly outside the boundaries of the park or the administrative site the Secretary may, in order to minimize the payment of severance damages, acquire the whole of the tract or parcel and exchange that part of it which is outside the boundaries for land or interests in land inside the boundaries or for other land or interests in land acquired pursuant to this subchapter, and dispose of so much thereof as is not so utilized in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. The cost of any land so acquired and disposed of shall not be charged against the limitation on authorized appropriations contained in section 79j of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Lands for screen of trees along certain highway</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is further authorized to acquire, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, lands and interests in land bordering both sides of the highway between the present southern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park and a point on Redwood Creek near the town of Orick to a depth sufficient to maintain or to restore a screen of trees between the highway and the land behind the screen and the activities conducted thereon.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Timber, soil, and stream protection; &#8220;interests in land&#8221; defined; notice to Congress of intended action, costs, and benefits requisite for acquisitions, contracts, or cooperative agreements; availability of funds; authorization of appropriations; rehabilitative activities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to afford as full protection as is reasonably possible to the timber, soil, and streams within the boundaries of the park, the Secretary is authorized, by any of the means set out in subsections (a) and (c) of this section, to acquire interests in land from, and to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, the owners of land on the periphery of the park and on watersheds tributary to streams within the park designed to assure that the consequences of forestry management, timbering, land use, and soil conservation practices conducted thereon, or of the lack of such practices, will not adversely affect the timber, soil, and streams within the park as aforesaid. As used in this subsection, the term &#8220;interests in land&#8221; does not include fee title unless the Secretary finds that the cost of a necessary less-than-fee interest would be disproportionately high as compared with the estimated cost of the fee. No acquisition other than by donation shall be effectuated and no contract or cooperative agreement shall be executed by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this subsection until after he has notified the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of his intended action and of the costs and benefits to the United States involved therein.
