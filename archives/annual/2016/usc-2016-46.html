&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may prescribe regulations&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establishing minimum safety standards for recreational vessels and associated equipment, and establishing procedures and tests required to measure conformance with those standards, with each standard&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meeting the need for recreational vessel safety; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) being stated, insofar as practicable, in terms of performance;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring the installation, carrying, or use of associated equipment (including fuel systems, ventilation systems, electrical systems, sound-producing devices, firefighting equipment, lifesaving devices, signaling devices, ground tackle, life- and grab-rails, and navigational equipment) on recreational vessels and classes of recreational vessels subject to this chapter, and prohibiting the installation, carrying, or use of associated equipment that does not conform with safety standards established under this section; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring or permitting the display of seals, labels, plates, insignia, or other devices for certifying or evidencing compliance with safety regulations and standards of the United States Government for recreational vessels and associated equipment.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each regulation prescribed under this section shall specify an effective date that is not earlier than 180 days from the date the regulation was published, unless the Secretary finds that there exists a recreational vessel safety hazard so critical as to require an earlier effective date. However, this period may not be more than 24 months for cases involving, in the discretion of the Secretary, major product design, retooling, or major changes in the manufacturing process.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) In prescribing regulations under this section, the Secretary shall, among other things&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider the need for and the extent to which the regulations will contribute to recreational vessel safety;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider relevant available recreational vessel safety standards, statistics, and data, including public and private research, development, testing, and evaluation;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) not compel substantial alteration of a recreational vessel or item of associated equipment that is in existence, or the construction or manufacture of which is begun before the effective date of the regulation, but subject to that limitation may require compliance or performance, to avoid a substantial risk of personal injury to the public, that the Secretary considers appropriate in relation to the degree of hazard that the compliance will correct; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consult with the National Boating Safety Advisory Council established under section 13110 of this title about the considerations referred to in clauses (1)&#8211;(3) of this subsection.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Section 8903 of this title does not apply to a vessel being operated for bona fide dealer demonstrations provided without fee to business invitees. However, if on the basis of substantial evidence, the Secretary decides under this section that requiring vessels so operated to be under the control of licensed individuals is necessary for boating safety, then the Secretary may prescribe regulations requiring the licensing of individuals controlling these vessels in the same manner as provided in chapter 89 of this title for individuals in control of vessels carrying passengers for hire.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Under this section, a model year for recreational vessels and associated equipment shall, except as provided in paragraph (2)&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) begin on June 1 of a year and end on July 31 of the following year; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be designated by the year in which it ends.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the request of a recreational vessel manufacturer to which this chapter applies, the Secretary may alter a model year for a model of recreational vessel of the manufacturer and associated equipment, by no more than 6 months from the model year described in paragraph (1).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A person willfully operating a recreational vessel in violation of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter shall be fined not more than $5,000, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A person violating section 4307(a) of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000, except that the maximum civil penalty may be not more than $250,000 for a related series of violations.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary decides under section 4310(f) that a recreational vessel or associated equipment contains a defect related to safety or fails to comply with an applicable regulation and directs the manufacturer to provide the notifications specified in this chapter, any person, including a director, officer or executive employee of a corporation, who knowingly and willfully fails to comply with that order, may be fined not more than $10,000, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a corporation violates section 4307(a), or fails to comply with the Secretary's decision under section 4310(f), any director, officer, or executive employee of the corporation who knowingly and willfully ordered, or knowingly and willfully authorized, a violation is individually liable to the Government for a penalty under paragraphs (1) or (2) in addition to the corporation. However, the director, officer, or executive employee is not liable individually under this subsection if the director, officer, or executive employee can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order or authorization was issued on the basis of a decision, in exercising reasonable and prudent judgment, that the defect or the nonconformity with standards and regulations constituting the violation would not cause or constitute a substantial risk of personal injury to the public; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at the time of the order or authorization, the director, officer, or executive employee advised the Secretary in writing of acting under this subparagraph and subparagraph (A).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) A person violating any other provision of this chapter or other regulation prescribed under this chapter is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000. If the violation involves the operation of a vessel, the vessel also is liable in rem for the penalty.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) When a civil penalty of not more than $200 has been assessed under this chapter, the Secretary may refer the matter of collection of the penalty directly to the United States magistrate judge of the jurisdiction in which the person liable may be found for collection procedures under supervision of the district court and under an order issued by the court delegating this authority under section 636(b) of title 28.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to restrain a violation of this chapter, or to restrain the sale, offer for sale, introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce, or importation into the United States, of a recreational vessel or associated equipment that the court decides does not conform to safety standards of the Government. A civil action under this subsection shall be brought by filing a petition by the Attorney General for the Government. When practicable, the Secretary shall give notice to a person against whom an action for injunctive relief is contemplated and provide the person with an opportunity to present views and, except for a knowing and willful violation, shall provide the person with a reasonable opportunity to achieve compliance. The failure to give notice and provide the opportunity does not preclude the granting of appropriate relief by the district court.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(f) A person is not subject to a penalty under this chapter if the person&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establishes that the person did not have reason to know, in exercising reasonable care, that a recreational vessel or associated equipment does not conform with the applicable safety standards of the Government or that the person was not advised by the Secretary or the manufacturer of that vessel, equipment or component that the vessel, equipment or component contains a defect which creates a substantial risk of personal injury to the public; or</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) holds a certificate issued by the manufacturer of that recreational vessel or associated equipment to the effect that the recreational vessel or associated equipment conforms to all applicable recreational vessel safety standards of the Government, unless the person knows or reasonably should have known that the recreational vessel or associated equipment does not so conform.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Wages are not dependent on the earning of freight by the vessel. When the loss or wreck of the vessel ends the service of a seaman before the end of the period contemplated in the agreement, the seaman is entitled to wages for the period of time actually served. The seaman shall be deemed a destitute seaman under section 11104 of this title. This subsection applies to a fishing or whaling vessel but not a yacht.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a seaman who has signed an agreement is discharged improperly before the beginning of the voyage or before one month's wages are earned, without the seaman's consent and without the seaman's fault justifying discharge, the seaman is entitled to receive from the master or owner, in addition to wages earned, one month's wages as compensation.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) A seaman is not entitled to wages for a period during which the seaman&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) unlawfully failed to work when required, after the time fixed by the agreement for the seaman to begin work; or</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) lawfully was imprisoned for an offense, unless a court hearing the case otherwise directs.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e) After the beginning of the voyage, a seaman is entitled to receive from the master, on demand, one-half of the balance of wages earned and unpaid at each port at which the vessel loads or delivers cargo during the voyage. A demand may not be made before the expiration of 5 days from the beginning of the voyage, not more than once in 5 days, and not more than once in the same port on the same entry. If a master does not comply with this subsection, the seaman is released from the agreement and is entitled to payment of all wages earned. Notwithstanding a release signed by a seaman under section 10312 of this title, a court having jurisdiction may set aside, for good cause shown, the release and take action that justice requires. This subsection does not apply to a fishing or whaling vessel or a yacht.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(f) At the end of a voyage, the master shall pay each seaman the balance of wages due the seaman within 24 hours after the cargo has been discharged or within 4 days after the seaman is discharged, whichever is earlier. When a seaman is discharged and final payment of wages is delayed for the period permitted by this subsection, the seaman is entitled at the time of discharge to one-third of the wages due the seaman.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), when payment is not made as provided under subsection (f) of this section without sufficient cause, the master or owner shall pay to the seaman 2 days' wages for each day payment is delayed.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The total amount required to be paid under paragraph (1) with respect to all claims in a class action suit by seamen on a passenger vessel capable of carrying more than 500 passengers for wages under this section against a vessel master, owner, or operator or the employer of the seamen shall not exceed ten times the unpaid wages that are the subject of the claims.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A class action suit for wages under this subsection must be commenced within three years after the later of&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date of the end of the last voyage for which the wages are claimed; or</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the receipt, by a seaman who is a claimant in the suit, of a payment of wages that are the subject of the suit that is made in the ordinary course of employment.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Subsections (f) and (g) of this section do not apply to a fishing or whaling vessel or a yacht.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) When a vessel is removed to a new State of principal operation, the issuing authority of that State shall recognize the validity of the number issued by the original State for 60 days.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a State has a numbering system approved after the Secretary issues a number, the State shall recognize the validity of the number issued by the Secretary for one year.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(f) When the Secretary decides that a State numbering system is not being carried out consistent with the standard numbering system or the State has changed the system without the Secretary's approval, the Secretary may withdraw approval after giving notice to the State, in writing, stating the reasons for the withdrawal.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Definitions.&#8212;In this subsection, the terms "dock area" and "within the port area" have the same meaning and scope as in the applicable collective bargaining agreement between the requesting labor organization and the carrier.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Disclosure.&#8212;An ocean common carrier that is a party to or is otherwise subject to a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization shall, in response to a written request by the labor organization, state whether it is responsible for the following work at a dock area or within a port area in the United States with respect to cargo transportation under a service contract:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The movement of the shipper's cargo on a dock area or within the port area or to or from railroad cars on a dock area or within the port area.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Existence of collective bargaining agreement.&#8212;This subsection does not require the disclosure of information by an ocean common carrier unless there exists an applicable and otherwise lawful collective bargaining agreement pertaining to that carrier. A disclosure by an ocean common carrier may not be deemed an admission or an agreement that any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A dispute about whether any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the responsibility of an ocean common carrier under a collective bargaining agreement shall be resolved solely in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement and the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), and without reference to this subsection.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Effect under other laws.&#8212;This subsection does not affect the lawfulness or unlawfulness under this part or any other Federal or State law of any collective bargaining agreement or element thereof, including any element that constitutes an essential term of a service contract.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Remedy for Breach.&#8212;Unless the parties agree otherwise, the exclusive remedy for a breach of a service contract is an action in an appropriate court. The contract dispute resolution forum may not be controlled by or in any way affiliated with a controlled carrier or by the government that owns or controls the carrier.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be fair and reasonable considering all circumstances;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall be provided from the time that a vessel or resource is required by the Secretary of Defense until the time that it is redelivered to the contractor and is available to reenter commercial service; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall be in addition to and shall not in any way reflect amounts payable under section 53106.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) ensure that each risk category is comprised of loans that are relatively homogeneous in cost and share characteristics predictive of defaults and other costs, given the facts known at the time of obligation or commitment, using a risk category system that is based on historical analysis of program data and statistical evidence concerning the likely costs of defaults or other costs that are expected to be associated with the loans in the category.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Use of system.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Placing obligation in category.&#8212;Before making a guarantee under this chapter for an obligation, and annually for projects subject to a guarantee, the Secretary or Administrator shall apply the risk factors specified in paragraph (4) to place the obligation in a risk category established under paragraph (2).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Reduction of available amount.&#8212;The Secretary or Administrator shall consider the total amount available to the Secretary or Administrator for making guarantees under this chapter to be reduced by the amount determined by multiplying&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the subsidy rate for the category in which the obligation is placed under subparagraph (A).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Estimated cost.&#8212;The estimated cost to the United States Government of a guarantee under this chapter for an obligation is deemed to be the amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the obligation.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Restriction on further guarantees.&#8212;The Secretary or Administrator may not guarantee obligations under this chapter after the total amount available to the Secretary or Administrator under appropriations laws for the cost of loan guarantees is considered to be reduced to zero under subparagraph (B).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Risk factors.&#8212;The risk factors referred to in this subsection are&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if applicable, the country risk for each eligible export vessel financed or to be financed by an obligation;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period for which an obligation is guaranteed or to be guaranteed;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of an obligation guaranteed or to be guaranteed in relation to the total cost of the project financed or to be financed by the obligation;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Present value for each year.&#8212;The amount referred to in paragraph (1) for a year in which the guarantee is in effect is the present value of the amount calculated under paragraph (3). To determine the present value, the Secretary or Administrator shall apply a discount rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, considering current market yields on outstanding obligations of the United States Government having periods to maturity comparable to the period to maturity for the guaranteed obligation.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Calculation of amount.&#8212;The amount referred to in paragraph (2) shall be calculated by multiplying&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) takes into account the security provided for the guaranteed obligation; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lowest allowable rate under paragraph (5) for the most creditworthy obligors; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the highest allowable rate under paragraph (5) for the least creditworthy obligors.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the excess of&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the principal amount of all obligations whose proceeds are to be so used; over</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 75 percent or 87.5 percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this title, of the amount paid by or for the account of the obligor for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel; plus</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any interest the Secretary or Administrator may require on the amount described in paragraph (1).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Security Involving Both Uncompleted and Delivered Vessels.&#8212;If the security for the guarantee of an obligation relates both to a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned and to a delivered vessel, the principal amount of the obligation shall be prorated for purposes of subsection (a) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or Administrator.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Disbursement Before Termination of Agreement.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Purposes.&#8212;The Secretary or Administrator shall disburse amounts in the escrow fund, as specified in the escrow agreement, to&#8212;</p>&#13;

The amount shall be credited against amounts due or to become due from the obligor to the Secretary or Administrator on the guaranteed obligations or, to the extent not so required, be paid to the obligor.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Payments Required Before Disbursement.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;No disbursement shall be made under subsection (c) to any person until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5 percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this title, of the aggregate actual cost of the vessel, as previously approved by the Secretary or Administrator. If the aggregate actual cost of the vessel has increased since the Secretary's or Administrator's initial approval or if it increases after the first disbursement is permitted under this subsection, then no further disbursements shall be made under subsection (c) until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5 percent, as applicable, of the increase, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator, in the aggregate actual cost of the vessel. This paragraph does not require the Secretary or Administrator to consent to finance any increase in actual cost unless the Secretary or Administrator determines that such an increase in the obligation meets all the terms and conditions of this chapter or other applicable law.</p>&#13;

The Secretary or Administrator may require that the obligor provide a certificate from an independent party certifying that the requisite progress in construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning has taken place.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Disbursement on Termination of Agreement.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 75 percent or 87.5 percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this title, of the actual cost of the vessel to the extent paid; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtain information on shipbuilding loan guarantees, direct and indirect subsidies, and other favorable treatment of shipyards provided by foreign governments to shipyards in competition with United States shipyards;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consult regularly with United States shipbuilders to obtain the essential information about international shipbuilding competition on which to set terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2); and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide guidance to the Administrator in establishing terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Annual report.&#8212;Not later than January 31 of each year, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on activities of the Administrator under this section during the preceding year. The report shall include&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Required Findings.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Benefit to shipbuilding industry.&#8212;The Administrator may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Administrator finds that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be essential in time of war or national emergency.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Priority of documented vessels.&#8212;The Administrator may not make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Administrator determines that making the commitment will not result in denial of an economically sound application for a commitment to guarantee an obligation for a vessel documented under the laws of the United States and operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States. The Administrator has sole discretion in making the determination. In making the determination, the Administrator shall consider&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Restriction on Transfer of Vessel.&#8212;The Administrator may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the owner of the vessel agrees with the Administrator that the vessel will not be transferred to a country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United States.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Review by Secretary of Defense.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Notification.&#8212;The Administrator shall promptly notify the Secretary of Defense of the receipt of an application for a loan guarantee for an eligible export vessel.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Disapproval.&#8212;The Secretary of Defense, within 30 days after receiving the notice, may disapprove the guarantee based on an assessment of the potential use of the vessel in a manner that may harm the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a guarantee solely because of the type of vessel to be constructed.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Delegation.&#8212;The authority of the Secretary of Defense to disapprove a guarantee under this subsection may be delegated only to a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Prohibition.&#8212;The Administrator may not make a loan guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense under this subsection.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Expiration of Authority.&#8212;The Administrator may not issue a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel under this chapter after the last date on which such a commitment may be issued under any treaty or convention entered into after November 30, 1993, that prohibits guarantee of such an obligation.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Purposes.&#8212;The purposes of this subchapter are to&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) enable the Secretary of Agriculture to plan export programs effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation requirements applicable to those programs;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) take immediate and positive steps to promote the growth of the cargo-carrying capacity of the United States merchant marine;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expand international trade in United States agricultural commodities and products and develop, maintain, and expand markets for United States agricultural exports;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) improve the efficiency of administration of both the commodity purchasing and selling activities and the ocean transportation activities associated with export programs sponsored by the Secretary;</p>&#13;
