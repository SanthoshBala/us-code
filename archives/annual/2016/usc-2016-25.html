<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to cause an investigation to be made to determine whether the owners of non-Indian lands under Indian irrigation projects and under projects where the United States has purchased water rights for Indians are unable to pay irrigation charges, including construction, maintenance, and operating charges, because of inability to operate such lands profitably by reason of lack of fertility of the soil, inadequacy of water supply, defects of irrigation works, or for any other causes. Where the Secretary finds that said landowners are unable to make payment due to the existence of such causes, he may adjust, defer, or cancel such charges, in whole or in part, as the facts and conditions warrant. In adjusting or deferring any such charges the Secretary may enter into contracts with said land owners for the payment of past due charges, but such contracts shall not extend the payment of such charges over a period in excess of ten years.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) the rate of suicide of American Indians and Alaska Natives is 1.9 times higher than the national average rate; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rate of suicide of Indian and Alaska Native youth aged 15 through 24 is&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 3.5 times the national average rate; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the highest rate of any population group in the United States;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) many risk behaviors and contributing factors for suicide are more prevalent in Indian country than in other areas, including&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) history of previous suicide attempts;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) family history of suicide;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) easy access to lethal methods;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) exposure to the suicidal behavior of others;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) isolation; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) incarceration;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) according to national data for 2005, suicide was the second-leading cause of death for Indians and Alaska Natives of both sexes aged 10 through 34;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) the suicide rates of Indian and Alaska Native males aged 15 through 24 are&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) suicide clustering in Indian country affects entire tribal communities;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) death rates for Indians and Alaska Natives are statistically underestimated because many areas of Indian country lack the proper resources to identify and monitor the presence of disease;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 1/3 of health needs in Indian country relate to mental health;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) often, the lack of resources of Indian tribes and the remote nature of Indian reservations make it difficult to meet the requirements necessary to access Federal assistance, including grants;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Service have established specific initiatives to combat youth suicide in Indian country and among Indians and Alaska Natives throughout the United States, including the National Suicide Prevention Initiative of the Service, which has worked with Service, tribal, and urban Indian health programs since 2003;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) conduct a study to determine&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a maximum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the smallest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a minimum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the largest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a standard direct cost base which is the aggregate direct cost funding level for which the percentage determined under subsection (d) will&#8212;</p>&#13;

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Owner-managed status of an interest may be revoked upon written request of the owners (including the parents or legal guardians of minors or incompetent owners) of all trust or restricted interests in the parcel, submitted to the Secretary in accordance with regulations adopted under subsection (l).</p>&#13;

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of revocation</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Revocation of owner-managed status under paragraph (2) shall not affect the validity of any lease made in accordance with the provisions of this section prior to the effective date of the revocation, provided that, after such revocation becomes effective, the Secretary shall be responsible for the collection of, and accounting for, all future lease revenues accruing to the trust or restricted interests in the parcel from and after such effective date.</p>&#13;

&#13;

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2401 &#183; Congressional findings</h3>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal Government has a historical relationship and unique legal and moral responsibility to Indian tribes and their members,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) included in this responsibility is the treaty, statutory, and historical obligation to assist the Indian tribes in meeting the health and social needs of their members,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) alcoholism and alcohol and substance abuse is the most severe health and social problem facing Indian tribes and people today and nothing is more costly to Indian people than the consequences of alcohol and substance abuse measured in physical, mental, social, and economic terms,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) alcohol and substance abuse is the leading generic risk factor among Indians, and Indians die from alcoholism at over 4 times the age-adjusted rates for the United States population and alcohol and substance misuse results in a rate of years of potential life lost nearly 5 times that of the United States,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) 4 of the top 10 causes of death among Indians are alcohol and drug related injuries (18 percent of all deaths), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (5 percent), suicide (3 percent), and homicide (3 percent),</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) primarily because deaths from unintentional injuries and violence occur disproportionately among young people, the age-specific death rate for Indians is approximately double the United States rate for the 15 to 45 age group,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are more than 2 times as likely to commit suicide as the general population and approximately 80 percent of those suicides are alcohol-related,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are twice as likely as the general population to die in automobile accidents, 75 percent of which are alcohol-related,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the Indian Health Service, which is charged with treatment and rehabilitation efforts, has directed only 1 percent of its budget for alcohol and substance abuse problems,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has responsibility for programs in education, social services, law enforcement, and other areas, has assumed little responsibility for coordinating its various efforts to focus on the epidemic of alcohol and substance abuse among Indian people,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) this lack of emphasis and priority continues despite the fact that Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service officials publicly acknowledge that alcohol and substance abuse among Indians is the most serious health and social problem facing the Indian people, and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the Indian tribes have the primary responsibility for protecting and ensuring the well-being of their members and the resources made available under this chapter will assist Indian tribes in meeting that responsibility.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2402 &#183; Purpose</h3>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to&#8212;</p>&#13;

&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recognition</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Congress recognizes that the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.], which was a product of the legitimate aspirations and a recognition of the inherent authority of Indian nations, was and is a crucial positive step toward tribal and community control and that the United States has an obligation to assure maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational services so as to render the persons administering such services and the services themselves more responsive to the needs and desires of Indian communities.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commitment</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing trust relationship with and responsibility to the Indian people for the education of Indian children through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy for education that will deter further perpetuation of Federal bureaucratic domination of programs.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) National goal</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares that a national goal of the United States is to provide the resources, processes, and structure that will enable tribes and local communities to obtain the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities that will permit Indian children&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to compete and excel in areas of their choice; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Educational needs</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Congress affirms&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process that will ensure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that Indian people have special and unique educational needs, including the need for programs to meet the linguistic and cultural aspirations of Indian tribes and communities; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that those needs may best be met through a grant process.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal relations</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares a commitment to the policies described in this section and support, to the full extent of congressional responsibility, for Federal relations with the Indian nations.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Congress repudiates and rejects House Concurrent Resolution 108 of the 83d Congress and any policy of unilateral termination of Federal relations with any Indian nation.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) numerous Indian tribes have become engaged in or have licensed gaming activities on Indian lands as a means of generating tribal governmental revenue;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Federal courts have held that section 81 of this title requires Secretarial review of management contracts dealing with Indian gaming, but does not provide standards for approval of such contracts;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) existing Federal law does not provide clear standards or regulations for the conduct of gaming on Indian lands;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a principal goal of Federal Indian policy is to promote tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and strong tribal government; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Indian tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands if the gaming activity is not specifically prohibited by Federal law and is conducted within a State which does not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming activity.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this chapter is&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide a statutory basis for the regulation of gaming by an Indian tribe adequate to shield it from organized crime and other corrupting influences, to ensure that the Indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation, and to assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly by both the operator and players; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to declare that the establishment of independent Federal regulatory authority for gaming on Indian lands, the establishment of Federal standards for gaming on Indian lands, and the establishment of a National Indian Gaming Commission are necessary to meet congressional concerns regarding gaming and to protect such gaming as a means of generating tribal revenue.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except for any assessments that may be agreed to under paragraph (3)(C)(iii) of this subsection, nothing in this section shall be interpreted as conferring upon a State or any of its political subdivisions authority to impose any tax, fee, charge, or other assessment upon an Indian tribe or upon any other person or entity authorized by an Indian tribe to engage in a class III activity. No State may refuse to enter into the negotiations described in paragraph (3)(A) based upon the lack of authority in such State, or its political subdivisions, to impose such a tax, fee, charge, or other assessment.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this subsection shall impair the right of an Indian tribe to regulate class III gaming on its Indian lands concurrently with the State, except to the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with, or less stringent than, the State laws and regulations made applicable by any Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe under paragraph (3) that is in effect.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described in subparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiations under paragraph (3)(A).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), upon the introduction of evidence by an Indian tribe that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall consider any demand by the State for direct taxation of the Indian tribe or of any Indian lands as evidence that the State has not negotiated in good faith.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;2901 &#183; Findings</h3>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the status of the cultures and languages of Native Americans is unique and the United States has the responsibility to act together with Native Americans to ensure the survival of these unique cultures and languages;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) special status is accorded Native Americans in the United States, a status that recognizes distinct cultural and political rights, including the right to continue separate identities;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the traditional languages of Native Americans are an integral part of their cultures and identities and form the basic medium for the transmission, and thus survival, of Native American cultures, literatures, histories, religions, political institutions, and values;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is a widespread practice of treating Native Americans&#160;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there is a lack of clear, comprehensive, and consistent Federal policy on treatment of Native American languages which has often resulted in acts of suppression and extermination of Native American languages and cultures;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is convincing evidence that student achievement and performance, community and school pride, and educational opportunity is clearly and directly tied to respect for, and support of, the first language of the child or student;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) it is clearly in the interests of the United States, individual States, and territories to encourage the full academic and human potential achievements of all students and citizens and to take steps to realize these ends;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) acts of suppression and extermination directed against Native American languages and cultures are in conflict with the United States policy of self-determination for Native Americans;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) languages are the means of communication for the full range of human experiences and are critical to the survival of cultural and political integrity of any people; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) language provides a direct and powerful means of promoting international communication by people who share languages.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">If a known lineal descendant or an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization requests the return of Native American unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony pursuant to this chapter and presents evidence which, if standing alone before the introduction of evidence to the contrary, would support a finding that the Federal agency or museum did not have the right of possession, then such agency or museum shall return such objects unless it can overcome such inference and prove that it has a right of possession to the objects.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, after careful review of the problem of child abuse on Indian reservations and the historical and special relationship of the Federal Government with Indian people,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) incidents of abuse of children on Indian reservations are grossly underreported;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such underreporting is often a result of the lack of a mandatory Federal reporting law;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) multiple incidents of sexual abuse of children on Indian reservations have been perpetrated by persons employed or funded by the Federal Government;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Federal Government investigations of the background of Federal employees who care for, or teach, Indian children are often deficient;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) funds spent by the United States on Indian reservations or otherwise spent for the benefit of Indians who are victims of child abuse or family violence are inadequate to meet the growing needs for mental health treatment and counseling for victims of child abuse or family violence and their families; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for membership in, an Indian tribe; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) declares that two major goals of the United States are to&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide funds for mental health treatment for Indian victims of child abuse and family violence on Indian reservations.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are to&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish a reliable data base for statistical purposes and to authorize a study to determine the need for a central registry for reported incidents of abuse;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize such other actions as are necessary to ensure effective child protection in Indian country;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establish the Indian Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Grant Program to provide funds for the establishment on Indian reservations of treatment programs for victims of child sexual abuse;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide for technical assistance and training related to the investigation and treatment of cases of child abuse and neglect;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) establish Indian Child Resource and Family Services Centers in each Bureau of Indian Affairs Area Office which will consist of multi-disciplinary teams of personnel with experience and training in the prevention, identification, investigation, and treatment of child abuse and neglect;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) provide for the treatment and prevention of incidents of family violence;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establish tribally operated programs to protect Indian children and reduce the incidents of family violence in Indian country; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) authorize other actions necessary to ensure effective child protection on Indian reservations.</p>&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there are increasing numbers of Indian students qualifying for postsecondary education, and there are increasing numbers desiring to go to postsecondary institutions;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the needs of these students far outpace the resources available currently;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Indian tribes have shown an increasing interest in administering programs serving these individuals and making decisions on these programs reflecting their determinations of the tribal and human needs;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the contracting process under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] has provided a mechanism for the majority of the tribes to assume control over this program from the Bureau of Indian Affairs;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) however, inherent limitations in the contracting philosophy and mechanism, coupled with cumbersome administrative procedures developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have effectively limited the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the provision of these services in the most effective and efficient form possible is necessary for tribes, the country, and the individuals to be served; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) these services are part of the Federal Government's continuing trust responsibility to provide education services to American Indian and Alaska Natives.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is a government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian tribes;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Indian tribes are sovereign entities and are responsible for exercising governmental authority over Indian lands;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the rate of violent crime committed in Indian country is approximately twice the rate of violent crime committed in the United States as a whole;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in any community, a high rate of violent crime is a major obstacle to investment, job creation and economic growth;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal governments and serve as important forums for ensuring the health and safety and the political integrity of tribal governments;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized tribal justice systems as the most appropriate forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property rights on Native lands;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) enhancing tribal court systems and improving access to those systems serves the dual Federal goals of tribal political self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) there is both inadequate funding and an inadequate coordinating mechanism to meet the technical and legal assistance needs of tribal justice systems and this lack of adequate technical and legal assistance funding impairs their operation;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) tribal court membership organizations have served a critical role in providing training and technical assistance for development and enhancement of tribal justice systems;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Indian legal services programs, as funded partially through the Legal Services Corporation, have an established record of providing cost effective legal assistance to Indian people in tribal court forums, and also contribute significantly to the development of tribal courts and tribal jurisprudence; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the provision of adequate technical assistance to tribal courts and legal assistance to both individuals and tribal courts is an essential element in the development of strong tribal court systems.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary of the Interior has identified 53 dams on Indian lands that present a threat to human life in the event of a failure;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of inadequate attention in the past to problems stemming from structural deficiencies and regular maintenance requirements for dams operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, unsafe Bureau dams continue to pose an imminent threat to people and property;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) many Bureau dams have maintenance deficiencies regardless of their current safety condition classification and the deficiencies must be corrected to avoid future threats to human life and property;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) safe working dams on Indian lands are necessary to supply irrigation water, to provide flood control, to provide water for municipal, industrial, domestic, livestock, and recreation uses, and for fish and wildlife habitats; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) it is necessary to institute a regular dam maintenance and repair program, utilizing the expertise in the Bureau, Indian tribes, and other Federal agencies.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a dam safety maintenance and repair program within the Bureau to ensure maintenance and monitoring of the condition of each dam identified pursuant to subsection (e) necessary to maintain the dam in a satisfactory condition on a long-term basis.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer of existing functions and personnel</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">All functions performed before August 23, 1994, pursuant to the Dam Safety Program established by the Secretary of the Interior by order dated February 28, 1980, and all Bureau of Indian Affairs personnel assigned to such program as of August 23, 1994, are hereby transferred to the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program. Any reference in any law, regulation, executive order, reorganization plan, or delegation of authority to the Dam Safety Program is deemed to be a reference to the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rehabilitation</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Under the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program, the Secretary shall perform such rehabilitation work as is necessary to bring the dams identified pursuant to subsection (e) to a satisfactory condition. In addition, each dam located on Indian lands shall be regularly maintained pursuant to the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program established pursuant to subsection (a).</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Maintenance action plan</h4>&#13;

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Unsatisfactory</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A dam safety deficiency exists for normal loading conditions. Immediate remedial action is required for resolution of the problem.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Risk hazard classification</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The risk hazard classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following classifications:</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) High</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Six or more lives would be at risk or extensive property damage could occur if the dam failed.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Significant</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Between one and six lives would be at risk or significant property damage could occur if the dam failed.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal Government, State, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages is acute and the Federal Government shall work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their members; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities shall be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93&#8211;638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The failure of a recipient to comply with the requirements of section 4152(b)(1) of this title regarding the reporting of low-income dwelling units shall not, in itself, be considered to be substantial noncompliance for purposes of this subchapter.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, if the Secretary makes a determination that the failure of a recipient of assistance under this chapter to comply substantially with any material provision (as that term is defined by the Secretary) of this chapter is resulting, and would continue to result, in a continuing expenditure of Federal funds in a manner that is not authorized by law, the Secretary may take an action described in paragraph (1)(C) before conducting a hearing.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is not a pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance, and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is a result of the limited capability or capacity of the recipient,</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary may provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability and capacity of the recipient to administer assistance provided under this chapter in compliance with the requirements under this chapter, if the recipient enters into a performance agreement with the Secretary that specifies the compliance objectives that the recipient will be required to achieve by the termination date of the performance agreement.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect of review</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the basis of a review under paragraph (3), the Secretary determines that the recipient&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has made a good faith effort to meet the compliance objectives specified in the agreement, the Secretary may enter into an additional performance agreement for the period specified in paragraph (2); and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has failed to make a good faith effort to meet applicable compliance objectives, the Secretary shall determine the recipient to have failed to comply substantially with this chapter, and the recipient shall be subject to an action under subsection (a).</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Referral for civil action</h4>&#13;

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of, or in addition to, any action authorized by subsection (a), if the Secretary has reason to believe that a recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter, the Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil action</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the assistance furnished under this chapter that was not expended in accordance with it, or for mandatory or injunctive relief.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;4301 &#183; Findings; purposes</h3>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the United States and Indian tribes;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon Administration of the Indian self-determination era, each President has reaffirmed the special government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies that obligated all Federal departments and agencies, particularly those that have an impact on economic development, to evaluate the potential impacts of their actions on Indian tribes;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consistent with the principles of inherent tribal sovereignty and the special relationship between Indian tribes and the United States, Indian tribes retain the right to enter into contracts and agreements to trade freely, and seek enforcement of treaty and trade rights;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Congress has carried out the responsibility of the United States for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and the resources of Indian tribes through the endorsement of treaties, and the enactment of other laws, including laws that provide for the exercise of administrative authorities;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the United States has an obligation to guard and preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency among Indian tribes;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the capacity of Indian tribes to build strong tribal governments and vigorous economies is hindered by the inability of Indian tribes to engage communities that surround Indian lands and outside investors in economic activities on Indian lands;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) despite the availability of abundant natural resources on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, Native Americans suffer higher rates of unemployment, poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and associated social ills than those of any other group in the United States;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the United States has an obligation to assist Indian tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and political conditions with respect to Indian lands to&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) encourage investment from outside sources that do not originate with the tribes; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) facilitate economic ventures with outside entities that are not tribal entities;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the economic success and material well-being of Native American communities depends on the combined efforts of the Federal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, and individuals;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the lack of employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in the communities referred to in paragraph (7) has resulted in a multigenerational dependence on Federal assistance that is&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) insufficient to address the magnitude of needs; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) unreliable in availability; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the twin goals of economic self-sufficiency and political self-determination for Native Americans can best be served by making available to address the challenges faced by those groups&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the resources of the private market;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adequate capital; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) technical expertise.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To revitalize economically and physically distressed Native American economies by&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) encouraging the formation of new businesses by eligible entities, and the expansion of existing businesses; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) facilitating the movement of goods to and from Indian lands and the provision of services by Indians.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To promote private investment in the economies of Indian tribes and to encourage the sustainable development of resources of Indian tribes and Indian-owned businesses.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To promote the long-range sustained growth of the economies of Indian tribes.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To raise incomes of Indians in order to reduce the number of Indians at poverty levels and provide the means for achieving a higher standard of living on Indian reservations.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To encourage intertribal, regional, and international trade and business development in order to assist in increasing productivity and the standard of living of members of Indian tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency of the governing bodies of Indian tribes.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To promote economic self-sufficiency and political self-determination for Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings respecting historical and special legal relationship, and resultant responsibilities</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, after careful review of the Federal Government's historical and special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, American Indian people, finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the prolonged Federal domination of Indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of Indian people and their communities by depriving Indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Indian people will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further findings</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will insure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal responsibility for and assistance to education of Indian children has not effected the desired level of educational achievement or created the diverse opportunities and personal satisfaction which education can and should provide; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) parental and community control of the educational process is of crucial importance to the Indian people.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declaration of commitment</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Declaration of national goal</h4>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indians;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the fiduciary responsibilities of the United States to Indians also are founded in part on specific commitments made through written treaties and agreements securing peace, in exchange for which Indians have surrendered claims to vast tracts of land, which provided legal consideration for permanent, ongoing performance of Federal trust duties; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the foregoing historic Federal-tribal relations and understandings have benefitted the people of the United States as a whole for centuries and have established enduring and enforceable Federal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.</p>&#13;
