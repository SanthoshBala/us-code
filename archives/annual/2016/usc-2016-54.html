<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the National Park System, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States and its territories and possessions;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their interrelated purposes and resources into one National Park System as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superb environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one System preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) it is the purpose of this division to include all these areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the System.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 1978 reaffirmation.&#8212;Congress reaffirms, declares, and directs that the promotion and regulation of the various System units shall be consistent with and founded in the purpose established by subsection (a), to the common benefit of all the people of the United States. The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and administration of the System units shall be conducted in light of the high public value and integrity of the System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which the System units have been established, except as directly and specifically provided by Congress.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Definitions.&#8212;In this section:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Capital improvement.&#8212;The term "capital improvement" means a structure, a fixture, or nonremovable equipment provided by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract and located on land of the United States within a System unit.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Consumer price index.&#8212;The term "Consumer Price Index" means&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the "Consumer Price Index&#8212;All Urban Consumers" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor; or</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the Index is not published, another regularly published cost-of-living index approximating the Consumer Price Index.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Leasehold Surrender Interest in Capital Improvements.&#8212;A concessioner that constructs a capital improvement on land owned by the United States within a System unit pursuant to a concession contract shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a concession contract, consisting solely of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Pledge as security.&#8212;A leasehold surrender interest may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concession contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Transfer and relinquishment or waiver of interest.&#8212;A leasehold surrender interest shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concession contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Limit on extinguishing or taking interest.&#8212;A leasehold surrender interest shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concession contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Value of interest.&#8212;The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) by the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Value of interest in certain new concession contracts.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) How value is determined.&#8212;The Secretary may provide, in any new concession contract that the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on November 12, 1998; or</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) When alternative formula may be used.&#8212;The Secretary may use an alternative formula under subparagraph (A)(ii) only if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in the particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that the alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (5), necessary to provide a fair return to the Federal Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes the alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (5).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Increase in value of interest.&#8212;Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concession contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of the additional capital improvement shall be added to the then-current value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Special Rule for Possessory Interest Existing Before November 13, 1998.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;A concessioner that has obtained a possessory interest (as defined pursuant to the Act of October 9, 1965 (known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; Public Law 89&#8211;249, 79 Stat. 969), as in effect on November 12, 1998) under the terms of a concession contract entered into before November 13, 1998, shall, on the expiration or termination of the concession contract, be entitled to receive compensation for the possessory interest improvements in the amount and manner as described by the concession contract. Where that possessory interest is not described in the existing concession contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on November 12, 1998.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Existing concessioner awarded a new contract.&#8212;A concessioner awarded a new concession contract to replace an existing concession contract after November 13, 1998, instead of directly receiving the possessory interest compensation, shall have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new concession contract and shall carry over as the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of the possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) New concessioner awarded a contract.&#8212;A new concessioner awarded a concession contract and required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the prior improvements. The initial value in the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) De novo review of value determination.&#8212;If the Secretary, or either party to a value determination proceeding conducted under a Service concession contract issued before November 13, 1998, considers that the value determination decision issued pursuant to the proceeding misinterprets or misapplies relevant contractual requirements or their underlying legal authority, the Secretary or either party may seek, within 180 days after the date of the decision, de novo review of the value determination decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims may make an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the determination decision.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Transition to Successor Concessioner.&#8212;On expiration or termination of a concession contract entered into after November 13, 1998, a concessioner shall be entitled under the terms of the concession contract to receive from the United States or a successor concessioner the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement as of the date of the expiration or termination. A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement under the terms of a new concession contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement (instead of construction cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold surrender interest under the terms of the prior concession contract.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Title to Improvements.&#8212;Title to any capital improvement constructed by a concessioner on land owned by the United States in a System unit shall be vested in the United States.</p>&#13;

The approval process utilized by the Secretary shall be as prompt and as unburdensome to the concessioner as possible and shall rely on market forces to establish reasonableness of rates and charges to the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary shall approve rates and charges that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and appropriate. Unless otherwise provided in the concession contract, the reasonableness and appropriateness of rates and charges shall be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and charges for facilities, goods, and services of comparable character under similar conditions, with due consideration to the following factors and other factors deemed relevant by the Secretary:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Length of season.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In General.&#8212;A concession contract shall provide for payment to the Federal Government of a franchise fee or other monetary consideration as determined by the Secretary, on consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of the privileges granted by the particular contract involved. Probable value shall be based on a reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested and the obligations of the concession contract. Consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting and preserving System units and of providing necessary and appropriate services for visitors at reasonable rates.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Provisions To Be Specified in Contract.&#8212;The amount of the franchise fee or other monetary consideration paid to the United States for the term of the concession contract shall be specified in the concession contract and may be modified only to reflect extraordinary unanticipated changes from the conditions anticipated as of the effective date of the concession contract. The Secretary shall include in concession contracts with a term of more than 5 years a provision that allows reconsideration of the franchise fee at the request of the Secretary or the concessioner in the event of extraordinary unanticipated changes. The provision shall provide for binding arbitration in the event that the Secretary and the concessioner are unable to agree on an adjustment to the franchise fee in those circumstances.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Special Account in Treasury.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Deposit and availability.&#8212;All franchise fees (and other monetary consideration) paid to the United States pursuant to concession contracts shall be deposited in a special account established in the Treasury. Twenty percent of the funds deposited in the special account shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation, to support activities throughout the System regardless of the System unit in which the funds were collected. The funds deposited in the special account shall remain available until expended.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Subaccount for each system unit.&#8212;There shall be established within the special account a subaccount for each System unit. Each subaccount shall be credited with 80 percent of the franchise fees (and other monetary consideration) collected at a single System unit under concession contracts. The funds credited to the subaccount for a System unit shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation, for use at the System unit for visitor services and for purposes of funding high-priority and urgently necessary resource management programs and operations. The funds credited to a subaccount shall remain available until expended.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;104906 &#183; Protection of right of individuals to bear arms</h3>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Findings.&#8212;Congress finds the following:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The 2d amendment to the Constitution provides that "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed".</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that "except as otherwise provided in this section and parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska regulations), the following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a weapon, trap or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, trap or net".</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising the 2d amendment rights of the individuals while at System units.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The existence of different laws relating to the transportation and possession of firearms at different System units entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at System units.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations relating to the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens in System units that went into effect on January 9, 2009&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction with respect to the implementation and enforcement of the new regulations; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the new regulations&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are under review by the Obama administration; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be altered.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens on 83,600,000 acres of System land.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment rights of an individual at a System unit should not be infringed.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Protection of Right of Individuals To Bear Arms in System Units.&#8212;The Secretary shall not promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm, including an assembled or functional firearm, in any System unit if&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the law of the State in which the System unit is located.</p>&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Authority of Secretary To Make Payments.&#8212;The Secretary may provide financial assistance to the States from amounts available for State purposes. Payments may be made to the States by the Secretary as provided in this section, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate and in the public interest to carry out the purposes of this chapter, for outdoor recreation:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Planning.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Acquisition of land, water, or interests in land or water.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Development.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Apportionment Among States.&#8212;Amounts appropriated and available for State purposes for each fiscal year shall be apportioned among the States by the Secretary, whose determination shall be final, in accordance with the following formula:</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Forty percent of the 1st $225,000,000; 30 percent of the next $275,000,000; and 20 percent of all additional appropriations shall be apportioned equally among the States.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) At any time, the remaining appropriation shall be apportioned on the basis of need to individual States by the Secretary in such amounts as in the Secretary's judgment will best accomplish the purposes of this chapter. The determination of need shall include consideration of&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the proportion that the population of each State bears to the total population of the United States;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the use of outdoor recreation resources of each State by persons from outside the State; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Federal resources and programs in each State.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The total allocation to a State under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to all of the States in any one year.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary shall notify each State of its apportionments. The amounts shall be available for payment to the State for planning, acquisition, or development projects as prescribed. Any amount of any apportionment that has not been paid or obligated by the Secretary during the fiscal year in which the notification is given and for 2 fiscal years thereafter shall be reapportioned by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2) without regard to the 10 percent limitation to an individual State specified in this subsection.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands shall be deemed to be one State, and shall receive shares of the apportionment in proportion to their populations.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Matching Requirements.&#8212;Payments to any State shall cover not more than 50 percent of the cost of planning, acquisition, or development projects that are undertaken by the State. The remaining share of the cost shall be borne by the State in a manner and with funds or services as shall be satisfactory to the Secretary.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Comprehensive State Plan.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Required for consideration of financial assistance.&#8212;A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall be required prior to the consideration by the Secretary of financial assistance for acquisition or development projects. The plan shall be adequate if, in the judgment of the Secretary, it encompasses and will promote the purposes of this chapter. No plan shall be approved unless the chief executive official of the State certifies that ample opportunity for public participation in plan development and revision has been accorded. The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with others, criteria for public participation, which criteria shall constitute the basis for the certification by the chief executive official. The plan shall contain&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the name of the State agency that will have authority to represent and act for the State in dealing with the Secretary for purposes of this chapter;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) other necessary information, as determined by the Secretary.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Factors to be considered.&#8212;The plan shall take into account relevant Federal resources and programs and shall be correlated so far as practicable with other State, regional, and local plans. Where there exists or is in preparation for any particular State a comprehensive plan financed in part with funds supplied by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, any statewide outdoor recreation plan prepared for purposes of this part shall be based on the same population, growth, and other pertinent factors as are used in formulating plans financed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Provision of assistance when plan not otherwise available or to maintain plan.&#8212;The Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for projects for the preparation of a comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan when the plan is not otherwise available or for the maintenance of the plan.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Wetlands.&#8212;A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall specifically address wetlands within the State as an important outdoor recreation resource as a prerequisite to approval, except that a revised comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall not be required by the Secretary, if a State submits, and the Secretary, acting through the Director, approves, as a part of and as an addendum to the existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan, a wetlands priority plan developed in consultation with the State agency with responsibility for fish and wildlife resources and consistent with the national wetlands priority conservation plan developed under section 301 of the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3921) or, if the national plan has not been completed, consistent with the provisions of that section.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Projects for Land and Water Acquisition and Development of Basic Outdoor Recreation Facilities.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In general.&#8212;In addition to assistance for planning projects, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for the types of projects described in paragraphs (2) and (3), or combinations of those projects, if the projects are in accordance with the State comprehensive plan.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Acquisition of land or water.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In general.&#8212;Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for the acquisition of land, water, or an interest in land or water, or a wetland area or an interest in a wetland area, as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan (other than land, water, or an interest in land or water acquired from the United States for less than fair market value), but not including incidental costs relating to acquisition.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Retention of right of use and occupancy.&#8212;When a State provides that the owner of a single-family residence may, at the owner's option, elect to retain a right of use and occupancy for not less than 6 months after the date of acquisition of the residence and the owner elects to retain such a right&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits under sections 203 to 206 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4623 to 4626); and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for the purposes of those sections the owner shall not be deemed to be a displaced person as defined in section 101 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4601).</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Development of basic outdoor recreation facilities.&#8212;Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for development of basic outdoor recreation facilities to serve the general public, including the development of Federal land under lease to States for terms of 25 years or more. No assistance shall be available under this chapter to enclose or shelter a facility normally used for an outdoor recreation activity, but the Secretary may permit local funding, not to exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to a State in any one year, to be used for construction of a sheltered facility for a swimming pool or ice skating rink in an area where the Secretary determines that the construction is justified by the severity of climatic conditions and the increased public use made possible by the construction.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Payments.&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Criteria for making payments.&#8212;The Secretary may make a payment to a State only for a planning, acquisition, or development project that is approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall not make a payment for or on account of any project with respect to which financial assistance has been given or promised under any other Federal program or activity, and no financial assistance shall be given under any other Federal program or activity for or on account of any project with respect to which the assistance has been given or promised under this chapter. The Secretary may make payments from time to time in keeping with the rate of progress toward the satisfactory completion of a project. The approval of all projects and all payments, or any commitments relating thereto, shall be withheld until the Secretary receives appropriate written assurance from the State that the State has the ability and intention to finance its share of the cost of all of the projects, and to operate and maintain by acceptable standards, at State expense, the properties or facilities acquired or developed for public outdoor recreation use.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Payment recipients.&#8212;Payments for all projects shall be made by the Secretary to the chief executive official of the State or to a State official or agency designated by the chief executive official or by State law having authority and responsibility to accept and to administer funds paid under this section for approved projects. If consistent with an approved project, funds may be transferred by the State to a political subdivision or other appropriate public agency.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Conversion to other than public outdoor recreation use.&#8212;No property acquired or developed with assistance under this section shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other than public outdoor recreation use. The Secretary shall approve a conversion only if the Secretary finds it to be in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan and only on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the substitution of other recreation properties of at least equal fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. Wetland areas and interests therein as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan and proposed to be acquired as suitable replacement property within the same State that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be deemed to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property proposed for conversion.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Reports and accounting procedures.&#8212;No payment shall be made to any State until the State has agreed to&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide such reports to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform the Secretary's duties under this chapter; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State under this chapter.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Records.&#8212;A recipient of assistance under this chapter shall keep such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records that fully disclose&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which the assistance is given or used; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Access to Records.&#8212;The Secretary, and the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any records of the recipient that are pertinent to assistance received under this chapter.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Prohibition of Discrimination.&#8212;With respect to property acquired or developed with assistance from the Fund, discrimination on the basis of residence, including preferential reservation or membership systems, is prohibited except to the extent that reasonable differences in admission and other fees may be maintained on the basis of residence.</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body">(j) Coordination With Federal Agencies.&#8212;To ensure consistency in policies and actions under this chapter with other related Federal programs and activities and to ensure coordination of the planning, acquisition, and development assistance to States under this section with other related Federal programs and activities&#8212;</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the President may issue such regulations with respect thereto as the President considers desirable; and</p>&#13;

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the assistance may be provided only in accordance with the regulations.</p>&#13;
