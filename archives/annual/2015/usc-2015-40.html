<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Transmittal to congress.&#8212;The explanatory statement shall be transmitted to the appropriate committees of Congress in advance of the disposal, and a copy of the statement shall be preserved in the files of the executive agency making the disposal.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Listing in report.&#8212;A report of the Administrator under section 126 of this title must include a listing and description of any negotiated disposals of surplus property having an estimated fair market value of more than $15,000, in the case of real property, or $5,000, in the case of any other property, other than disposals for which an explanatory statement has been transmitted under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Person asserting claim entitled to benefits.&#8212;In a judicial proceeding under the laws of a State, district, territory, or possession of the United States, when property owned or held by the Federal Government, or in which the Government has or claims an interest, is seized, arrested, attached, or held for the security or satisfaction of a claim made against the property, the Attorney General may direct the United States Attorney for the district in which the property is located to enter a stipulation that on discharge of the property from the seizure, arrest, attachment, or proceeding, the person asserting the claim against the property becomes entitled to all the benefits of this section.</p>

When the claim is for the payment of money found to be due, presentation of an authenticated copy of the record of the judgment and proceedings is sufficient evidence to the proper accounting officers for the allowance of the claim, which shall be allowed and paid out of amounts in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated. The amount allowed and paid shall not exceed the value of the interest of the Government in the property.</p>

<h2 class="part-head">SUBTITLE IV&#8212;APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<h3 class="chapter-head">Chapter 141. General Provisions</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;14101 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) 1965 Findings and Purpose.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Findings.&#8212;Congress finds and declares that the Appalachian region of the United States, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of the Nation in its economic growth and that its people have not shared properly in the Nation's prosperity. The region's uneven past development, with its historical reliance on a few basic industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the economic base that is a vital prerequisite for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. State and local governments and the people of the region understand their problems and have been working, and will continue to work, purposefully toward their solution. Congress recognizes the comprehensive report of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission documenting these findings and concludes that regionwide development is feasible, desirable, and urgently needed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Purpose.&#8212;It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the region in meeting its special problems, to promote its economic development, and to establish a framework for joint federal and state efforts toward providing the basic facilities essential to its growth and attacking its common problems and meeting its common needs on a coordinated and concerted regional basis. The public investments made in the region under this subtitle shall be concentrated in areas where there is a significant potential for future growth and where the expected return on public dollars invested will be the greatest. States will be responsible for recommending local and state projects within their borders that will receive assistance under this subtitle. As the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources, Congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry and that the region will then be able to support itself through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) 1975 Findings and Purpose.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Findings.&#8212;Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the purposes set out in subsection (a), especially with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region but also its relationship to a nation that on December 31, 1975, is assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia as of December 31, 1975, has the opportunity, in accommodating future growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and coordinated planning so that housing, public services, transportation and other community facilities will be provided in a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of life for the people of the region, and consistent with that goal, the Appalachian region should be able to take advantage of eco-industrial development, which promotes both employment and economic growth and the preservation of natural resources. Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring in national energy requirements and production, which not only risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs to the region and its people.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Purpose.&#8212;It is also the purpose of this subtitle to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state and local efforts toward&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by federal, state, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation's energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, community facilities, and human services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) 1998 Findings and Purpose.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Findings.&#8212;Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made in fulfilling many of the objectives of this subtitle, rapidly changing national and global economies over the decade ending November 13, 1998, have created new problems and challenges for rural areas throughout the United States and especially for the Appalachian region.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Purpose.&#8212;In addition to the purposes stated in subsections (a) and (b), it is the purpose of this subtitle&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to assist the Appalachian region in&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) providing the infrastructure necessary for economic and human resource development;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developing the region's industry;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) building entrepreneurial communities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) generating a diversified regional economy; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) making the region's industrial and commercial resources more competitive in national and world markets;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state, and local initiatives to respond to the economic competitiveness challenges in the Appalachian region through&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) improving the skills of the region's workforce;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) adapting and applying new technologies for the region's businesses, including eco-industrial development technologies; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) improving the access of the region's businesses to the technical and financial resources necessary to development of the businesses; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to address the needs of severely and persistently distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus special attention on the areas of greatest need so as to provide a fairer opportunity for the people of the region to share the quality of life generally enjoyed by citizens across the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A State or political subdivision of a State is not eligible to receive benefits under this subtitle unless the aggregate expenditure of state amounts, except expenditures for participation in the Dwight D.

In computing the level, a State's past expenditure for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and expenditures of local and federal amounts shall not be included. The Commission shall recommend to the President a lesser requirement when it finds that a substantial population decrease in that part of a State which lies within the region would not justify a state expenditure equal to the average level of the last two years or when it finds that a State's average level of expenditure in an individual program has been disproportionate to the present need for that part of the State.</p>

<h3 class="chapter-head">Chapter 183. National Capital Area Interest Arbitration Standards</h3>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;18301 &#183; Findings and purposes</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Findings.&#8212;Congress finds that&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than two-thirds of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) federal legislation is necessary under section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Purpose.&#8212;The purpose of this chapter is to adopt standards governing arbitration that must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 107&#8211;217, Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1291.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;18302 &#183; Definitions</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">In this chapter, the following definitions apply:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Arbitration.&#8212;The term "arbitration"&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) means the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms and conditions of employment, that is required under an interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area; but</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not include the interpretation and application of rights arising from an existing collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Arbitrator.&#8212;The term "arbitrator" refers to either a single arbitrator, or a board of arbitrators, chosen under applicable procedures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area.&#8212;The term "interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area" means any interstate compact agency that provides public transit services and that was established by an interstate compact to which the District of Columbia is a signatory.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 107&#8211;217, Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1292.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;18303 &#183; Standards for arbitrators</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Definition.&#8212;In this section, the term "public welfare" includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing public transit services; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered under that arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions that provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Factors in Making Arbitration Award.&#8212;An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the continuity and stability of employment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The public welfare.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Ability To Finance Salaries and Benefits Provided in Award.&#8212;An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction that provides subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Requirements for Final Award.&#8212;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Written award.&#8212;In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (b) and (c) have been considered and applied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Prerequisites.&#8212;An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Substantial evidence.&#8212;The arbitrator's conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="source-credit">Pub. L. 107&#8211;217, Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1292.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&#167;18304 &#183; Procedures for enforcement of awards</h3>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Modifications and Finality of Award.&#8212;Within 10 days after the parties receive an arbitration award to which section 18303 of this title applies, the interstate compact agency and the employees, through their representative, may agree in writing on any modifications to the award. After the end of that 10-day period, the award, and any modifications, become binding on the interstate compact agency, the employees in the bargaining unit, and the employees' representative.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Implementation.&#8212;Each party to an award that becomes binding under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary to implement the award.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Judicial Review.&#8212;Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may bring a civil action in a court that has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a hearing, if&#8212;</p>
