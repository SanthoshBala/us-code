	* Diff types in USC01 (1994-1995):

		– "Valid through" date
		– substantive addition
		– substantive removal
	* Possible cleanup:
		– Remove header (id="header")

	* Figured out that you need a viewport meta tag to make the CSS pixel measurements work on mobile and desktop
	* Created beginnings of an end-to-end pipeline, and tested publishing to github.io
	* Discovered that there are other complex non-statutory elements that need to be removed, including repealed section
		headers. Might just need to do something custom for that case =(

# 08.07.2016
	* field-start:repealedhead – need to remove <h3> section-head's which have been repealed
