re-establishing them in power at this very time too, they are permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood but Scotch & foreign mercenaries to invade and deluge us in blood. these facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection, & manly spirit bids us to renounce for ever these unfeeling brethren! we must endeavor to forget our former love for them and to hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. we might have been a free & a great people together, but a communication of grandeur & of freedom it seems is below their dignity. be it so, since they will have it: the road to happiness & to glory is open to us too, we will climb it apart from them & acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our eternal separation.
